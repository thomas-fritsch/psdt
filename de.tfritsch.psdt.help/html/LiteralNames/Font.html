<A NAME="FontType"></A>
<DL>
<DT>Key<DD><B>FontType</B>
<DT>Type<DD>integer
<DT>Value<DD><I>(Required)</I> The font type; see Table 5.1. Indicates where the glyph descriptions
are to be found and how they are represented.
</DL>
<HR>
<A NAME="FontMatrix"></A>
<DL>
<DT>Key<DD><B>FontMatrix</B>
<DT>Type<DD>array
<DT>Value<DD><I>(Required)</I> An array that transforms the <I>glyph coordinate system</I> into the user
coordinate system (see Section 5.4, "Glyph Metric Information"). For
example, Type 1 font programs from Adobe are usually defined in terms of a
1000-unit glyph coordinate system, and their initial font matrix is
[0.001 0 0 0.001 0 0]. When a font is derived by the scalefont or makefont
operator, the new matrix is concatenated with the existing font matrix to
yield a new copy of the font with a different font matrix.
</DL>
<HR>
<A NAME="FontName"></A>
<DL>
<DT>Key<DD><B>FontName</B>
<DT>Type<DD>name
<DT>Value<DD><I>(Optional)</I> The name of the font. This entry is for information only; it is not
used by the PostScript interpreter. Ordinarily, it is the same as the key passed
to definefont, but it need not be.
</DL>
<HR>
<A NAME="FontInfo"></A>
<DL>
<DT>Key<DD><B>FontInfo</B>
<DT>Type<DD>dictionary
<DT>Value<DD><I>(Optional)</I> A dictionary containing font information that is not accessed by
the PostScript interpreter; see Table 5.5 on page 327.
</DL>
<HR>
<A NAME="LanguageLevel"></A>
<DL>
<DT>Key<DD><B>LanguageLevel</B>
<DT>Type<DD>integer
<DT>Value<DD><I>(Optional)</I> The minimum LanguageLevel required for correct behavior of the
font. For example, any font that uses LanguageLevel 2 features for rendering
glyphs (such as a glyph description that uses rectfill or glyphshow) should
specify a LanguageLevel value of 2. On the other hand, the presence of
higher-LanguageLevel information that an interpreter can safely ignore does
not require LanguageLevel to be set to the higher LanguageLevel. For
example, an XUID entry in the font dictionary—LanguageLevel 2 information
that a LanguageLevel 1 interpreter can ignore—does not require setting
LanguageLevel to 2. Default value: 1.
</DL>
<HR>
<A NAME="WMode"></A>
<DL>
<DT>Key<DD><B>WMode</B>
<DT>Type<DD>integer
<DT>Value<DD><I>(Optional; LanguageLevel 2)</I> The writing mode, which determines which of
two sets of metrics will be used when glyphs are shown from the font. Mode 0
specifies horizontal writing; mode 1 specifies vertical writing (see Section 5.4,
"Glyph Metric Information"). LanguageLevel 1 implementations lacking
composite font extensions ignore this entry. Default value: 0.
</DL>
<HR>
<A NAME="Encoding"></A>
<DL>
<DT>Key<DD><B>Encoding</B>
<DT>Type<DD>array
<DT>Value<DD><I>(Required)</I> An array of character names to which character codes are
mapped. See Section 5.3, "Character Encoding."
</DL>
<HR>
<A NAME="FontBBox"></A>
<DL>
<DT>Key<DD><B>FontBBox</B>
<DT>Type<DD>array
<DT>Value<DD><I>(Required)</I> An array of four numbers in the glyph coordinate system giving
the left, bottom, right, and top coordinates, respectively, of the font bounding
box. The font bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape that
would result if all of the glyphs of the font were placed with their origins coincident,
and then painted. This information is used in making decisions
about glyph caching and clipping. If all four values are 0, the PostScript interpreter
makes no assumptions based on the font bounding box.<BR>
If any value is nonzero, it is essential that the font bounding box be accurate;
if any glyph's marks fall outside this bounding box, incorrect behavior may
result.<BR>
In many Type 1 fonts, the FontBBox array is executable, though there is no
good reason for this to be so. Programs that access FontBBox should invoke
an explicit get or load operator to avoid unintended execution.

<HR>
<A NAME="BuildGlyph"></A>
<DL>
<DT>Key<DD><B>BuildGlyph</B>
<DT>Type<DD>procedure
<DT>Value<DD><I>(Optional; LanguageLevel 2)</I> A procedure that constructs the requested glyph.
The font dictionary, followed by the character name, is on the stack when the
procedure is called. See Section 5.7.1, "BuildGlyph."
</DL>
<HR>
<A NAME="BuildChar"></A>
<DL>
<DT>Key<DD><B>BuildChar</B>
<DT>Type<DD>procedure
<DT>Value<DD><I>(Required for LanguageLevel 1 or if BuildGlyph is absent)</I> A procedure that
constructs the requested glyph (only if no BuildGlyph entry is present, in
LanguageLevel 2 or 3). The font dictionary, followed by the character code, is
on the stack when the procedure is called. See Section 5.7.2, "BuildChar."
