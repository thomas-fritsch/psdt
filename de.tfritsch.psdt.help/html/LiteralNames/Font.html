	<tr>
		<td><b>FontMatrix</b></td>
		<td>array</td>
		<td><i>(Required)</i> An array that transforms the <i>glyph
				coordinate system</i> into the user coordinate system (see Section 5.4,
			"Glyph Metric Information"). For example, Type 1 font programs from
			Adobe are usually defined in terms of a 1000-unit glyph coordinate
			system, and their initial font matrix is [0.001 0 0 0.001 0 0]. When
			a font is derived by the <b>scalefont</b> or <b>makefont</b>
			operator, the new matrix is concatenated with the existing font
			matrix to yield a new copy of the font with a different font matrix.

	<tr>
		<td><b>FontName</b></td>
		<td>name</td>
		<td><i>(Optional)</i> The name of the font. This entry is for
			information only; it is not used by the PostScript interpreter.
			Ordinarily, it is the same as the key passed to <b>definefont</b>,
			but it need not be.</td>

		<td><b>FontInfo</b></td>
		<td>dictionary</td>
		<td><i>(Optional)</i> A dictionary containing font information
			that is not accessed by the PostScript interpreter; see Table 5.5 on
			page 327.</td>
	</tr>
	<a name="LanguageLevel"></a>
	<tr>
		<td><b>LanguageLevel</b></td>
		<td>integer</td>
		<td><i>(Optional)</i> The minimum LanguageLevel required for
			correct behavior of the font. For example, any font that uses
			LanguageLevel 2 features for rendering glyphs (such as a glyph
			description that uses <b>rectfill</b> or <b>glyphshow</b>) should
			specify a <b>LanguageLevel</b> value of 2. On the other hand, the
			presence of higher-LanguageLevel information that an interpreter can
			safely ignore does not require LanguageLevel to be set to the higher
			LanguageLevel. For example, an <b>XUID</b> entry in the font
			dictionary&mdash;LanguageLevel 2 information that a LanguageLevel 1
			interpreter can ignore&mdash;does not require setting <b>LanguageLevel</b>
			to 2. Default value: 1.</td>
	</tr>
	<a name="WMode"></a>
	<tr>
		<td><b>WMode</b></td>
		<td>integer</td>
		<td><i>(Optional; LanguageLevel 2)</i> The writing mode, which
			determines which of two sets of metrics will be used when glyphs are
			shown from the font. Mode 0 specifies horizontal writing; mode 1
			specifies vertical writing (see Section 5.4, "Glyph Metric
			Information"). LanguageLevel 1 implementations lacking composite font
			extensions ignore this entry. Default value: 0.</td>
	</tr>
	<a name="FID"></a>
	<tr>
		<td><b>FID</b></td>
		<td>fontID</td>
		<td><i>(Inserted by <b>definefont</b>)
		</i> A special object of type fontID that serves internal purposes in the
			font machinery. The <b>definefont</b> operator inserts this entry. In
			LanguageLevel 1, an <b>FID</b> entry must not previously exist in the
			dictionary presented to definefont; the dictionary must have
			sufficient space to insert this entry.</td>

	<a name="FontBBox"></a>
	<tr>
		<td><b>FontBBox</b></td>
		<td>array</td>
		<td><i>(Required)</i> An array of four numbers in the glyph
			coordinate system giving the left, bottom, right, and top
			coordinates, respectively, of the font bounding box. The font
			bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape that would
			result if all of the glyphs of the font were placed with their
			origins coincident, and then painted. This information is used in
			making decisions about glyph caching and clipping. If all four values
			are 0, the PostScript interpreter makes no assumptions based on the
			font bounding box.<BR> If any value is nonzero, it is essential
			that the font bounding box be accurate; if any glyph's marks fall
			outside this bounding box, incorrect behavior may result.<BR> In
			many Type 1 fonts, the <b>FontBBox</b> array is executable, though
			there is no good reason for this to be so. Programs that access <b>FontBBox</b>
			should invoke an explicit <b>get</b> or <b>load</b> operator to avoid
			unintended execution.</td>
