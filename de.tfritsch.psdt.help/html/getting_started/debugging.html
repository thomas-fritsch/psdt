	<h1>Debugging PostScript files</h1>
	<h2 id="debug_view">Debug View</h2>
	<p>
		The <b>Debug View</b> allows you to manage the debugging or running of
		a program in the workbench. It displays the stack frame for the
		suspended threads for each target you are debugging. Each thread in
		your program appears as a node in the tree. It displays the process
		for each target you are running.
	</p>
	<p>If the thread is suspended, its stack frames are shown as child
		elements.</p>
	<p>
		Because PostScript is a single-threaded language, you see only one
		thread. And because PostScript has an execution-model very different
		from other languages (like Java or C), the concept of stackframes
		doesn't make much sense here, and hence you see only one stackframe.
		However, you can inspect the stacks in the <a href="#variables_view"><b>Variables
				View</b></a>

		The <b>Variables View</b> displays information about the variables
		associated with the stack frame selected in the <a href="#debug_view"><b>Debug
				View</b></a>. You can expand the <a href="../Reference/3/4.html">stacks</a>
		and the state of the PostScript interpreter.

	<h2 id="breakpoints_view">Breakpoints View</h2>
	<p>
		The <b>Breakpoints View</b> lists all the breakpoints you currently
		have set in your workspace.
	</p>
	<p>You can double-click a breakpoint to display its location in the
