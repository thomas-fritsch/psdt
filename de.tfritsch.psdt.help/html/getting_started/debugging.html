	<h1>Debugging PostScript files</h1>
	<h2 id="debug_view">Debug View</h2>
	<p>
		The <b>Debug View</b> allows you to manage the debugging or running of
		a program in the workbench. It displays the stack frame for the
		suspended threads for each target you are debugging. Each thread in
		your program appears as a node in the tree. It displays the process
		for each target you are running.
	</p>
	<p>If the thread is suspended, its stack frames are shown as child
		elements.</p>
	<p>
		Because PostScript is a single-threaded language, you see only one
		thread. And because PostScript has an execution-model very different
		from other languages (like Java or C/C++), their concept of stack
		frames doesn't really fit here, and hence you see only one stack
		frame. However, you can inspect the stacks in the <a
			href="#variables_view"><b>Variables View</b></a>.
