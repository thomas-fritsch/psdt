<H2>Postscript Errors Definitions</H2>
<HR><A NAME="configurationerror"></A><B>configurationerror</B><BR>
setpagedevice request cannot be satisfied <BR>
Usually the app is trying to set too large a page for the printer <BR>
<BR>
To find the maximum page size your printer can handle:<BR>
1. Select an application that allows setting of a custom page size. ( I.E.
Trapwise, PressWise )<BR>
2. Open a generic document in the application<BR>
3. Select the print dialog<BR>
4. Select the PPD for the imagesetter 5. Select Custom as the paper size<BR>
6. Input large numbers into the width and depth settings<BR>
Note. Many imagesetters only allow a depth of around 27 inches even though
it uses a continious roll of film<BR>
7. Keep reducing the numbers until a page will print and the adjust your
numbers for each dimension seperately until the page size causes an error<BR>
<HR><A NAME="dictfull"></A><B>dictfull</B><BR>
no more room in the dictionary The application has tried to add more definitions
to the dictionary than originally allocated. This will only happen on a
Level 1 printer. <BR>
<BR>
This is caused by an application not checking if the correct dictionary
is selected before creating a new postscript definition. It will only be
seen if the postscript document is processed by more than one application.
( I.E. A postscript file is opened and printed by a seperations or imposition
program )<BR>
<HR><A NAME="dictstackoverflow"></A><B>dictstackoverflow</B><BR>
Too many 'begin' dictionary statements The application tried to make an
dictionary active that was not defined. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><A NAME="dictstackunderflow"></A><B>dictstackunderflow</B> Too many
'end' dictionary statements The application tried to close a dictionary
that was never opened. <BR>
<HR><BR>
<A NAME="execstackoverflow"></A><B>execstackoverflow</B><BR>
The execution procedure nesting has too many routines called by a defined
procedure <BR>
<HR><A NAME="handleerror"></A><B>handleerror</B><BR>
This procedure is called by the postscript program to report error information.
You should not see this for any non beta software.<HR><A NAME="interrupt"></A><B>interrupt<BR>
external </B><A NAME="ExtInterruptRequest"></A><B>interrupt request</B>
( control - C ) <BR>
This is a request to interrupt the exicution of the current postscript program.
This can show up when you cancel the printing of a postscript job or if
someone canceled the job at the imagesetter.<BR>
<HR><A NAME="invalidaccess"></A><B>invalidaccess</B><BR>
An attempt to violate an access attribute was made by the program. This
can be seen if the password protection was set at the printer to an non
default password. It will also be seen if the postscript tries to change
protected attributes of a printer without using the correct procedures<BR>
<HR><A NAME="invalidcontext"></A><B>invalidcontext</B><BR>
inproper use of context operation <BR>
<HR><A NAME="invalidexit"></A><B>invalidexit</B><BR>
The postscript codeword exit is not in a looping procedure <BR>
<HR><A NAME="invalidfileaccess"></A><B>invalidfileaccess</B><BR>
An incorrect access string for using a file was used. <BR>
Some files on an imagesetters disk are set to read only. If the postscript
code tries to overwrite the file with new information, it will cause this
error.<BR>
<HR><A NAME="invalidfont"></A><B>invalidfont</B><BR>
The postscript code used an invalid font name or the font dictionary is
not a valid font definition <BR>
<HR><A NAME="invalidid"></A><B>invalidid</B><BR>
invalid identifer for external object <BR>
<HR><A NAME="invalidrestore"></A><B>invalidrestore</B><BR>
A restore call is invalid. This usually occurs if the matching save state
has been erased by the postscript code before the restore statement has
a chance to be processed. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><A NAME="ioerror"></A><B>ioerror</B><BR>
An input or output error occured <BR>
<HR><A NAME="limitcheck"></A><B>limitcheck</B><BR>
An implementation limit was exceeded. This can be seen for various reasons.<BR>
1. A path is too complex for the imagesetter to process. The offending command
is usually eoclip, eofill, or fill.<BR>
2. The postscript code is using too many save states. A maximum of 15 save
states are allowed. The imagesetter uses 2 to 3, Each application that is
used to process the postscript will use 2 to 3, and some applications will
use up to 10 save states.<BR>
You can reduce the number of save states by using a minimum of imbedding
( placing a document inside a larger postscript document ) and by not using
a large number of font changes in a single document.<BR>
<HR><A NAME="nocurrentpoint"></A><B>nocurrentpoint</B><BR>
The current point is not defined. This is the point where the next drawing
operation is supposed to start. This error is usually only seen when the
postscript code has become corrupted. <BR>
<HR><A NAME="rangecheck"></A><B>rangecheck</B><BR>
operand value is out of bounds <BR>
<HR><A NAME="stackoverflow"></A><B>stackoverflow</B><BR>
operand stack overflow <BR>
<HR><A NAME="stackunderflow"></A><B>stackunderflow</B><BR>
operand stack underflow <BR>
<HR><A NAME="systaxerror"></A><B>systaxerror</B><BR>
postscript language syntax ( misspelled code word ) error <BR>
<HR><A NAME="timeout"></A><B>timeout</B><BR>
time limit exceeded <BR>
<HR><A NAME="typecheck"></A><B>typecheck</B><BR>
operand value is the wrong type ( Eg. boolean expected but value is Real
) <BR>
<HR><A NAME="undefined"></A><B>undefined</B><BR>
name not known <HR><A NAME="undefinedfilename"></A><B>undefinedfilename</B><BR>
called file is not found <HR><A NAME="undefinedresource"></A><B>undefinedresource</B><BR>
called resource cannot be found <HR><A NAME="undefinedresult"></A><B>undefinedresult</B><BR>
over or underflow or a meaningless result occured <HR><A NAME="unmatchedmark"></A><B>unmatchedmark</B><BR>
expected mark is not on the stack <HR><A NAME="unregistered"></A><B>unregistered</B><BR>
internal error <HR><A NAME="VMerror"></A><B>VMerror</B><BR>
No more Virtual memory is available
