<PRE>filename access file file</PRE>
<P>
creates a file object for the file identified by filename, accessing it
as specified by access. Both operands are strings. Conventions for both
file names and access specifications depend on the operating system environment
in which the PostScript interpreter is running.
<P>
Once created and opened, the file object remains valid until the file is
closed either explicitly (by executing <A HREF="c.html#closefile">closefile</A>)
or implicitly (by encountering end-offile while reading or executing the
file). A file is also closed by <A HREF="qr.html#restore">restore</A>
if the file object was created more recently than the <A HREF="s.html#save">save</A>
snapshot being restored, or is closed by garbage collection if the file
object is no longer accessible. There is a limit on the number of files
that can be open simultaneously.
<P>
If the specified filename is malformed or if the file doesn't exist and
access does not permit creating a new file, file executes an <A HREF="u.html#undefinedfilename">undefinedfilename</A>
error. If access is malformed or the requested access is not permitted by
the device, an <A HREF="ik.html#invalidfileaccess">invalidfileaccess</A>
error occurs. If the number of files opened by the current context exceeds
an implementation limit, a <A HREF="l.html#limitcheck">limitcheck</A>
error occurs. If an environmentdependent error is detected, an <A HREF="ik.html#ioerror">ioerror</A>
occurs.

<A NAME="filenameforall"></A>
<B>filenameforall</B> LEVEL 2
<PRE>template proc scratch filenameforall -</PRE>
<P>
enumerates all files whose names match the specified template string. For
each matching file, filenameforall copies the file's name into the supplied
scratch string, pushes a string object designating the substring of scratch
actually used, and calls proc. filenameforall does not return any results
of its own, but proc may do so.
<P>
The details of template matching are device dependent, but the following
convention is typical. All characters in the template are treated literally
and are case sensitive, except the following special characters:
<DL>
<DT>*<DD>matches zero or more consecutive characters.
<DT>?<DD>matches exactly one character.
<DT>\<DD>causes the next character of the template to be treated literally, even
if it is *, ?, or /.
</DL>
<P>
If template does not begin with %, it is matched against device relative
file names of all devices in the search order. When a match occurs, the
file name passed to proc
is likewise device relative-in other words, it does not have a %device%
prefix.
<P>
If template does begin with %, it is matched against complete file names
in the form %device%file. Template matching can be performed on the device,
the file, or both parts of the name. When a match occurs, the file name
passed to proc is likewise in the complete form %device%file.
<P>
The order of enumeration is unspecified and device dependent. There are
no restrictions on what proc can do. However, if proc causes new files to
be created, it is unspecified whether or not those files will be encountered
later in the same enumeration. Likewise, the set of file names considered
for template matching is device dependent.

Any previous contents of that area on the current page are obscured, so
areas may be erased by filling with color set to white.
<P>
Before painting, fill implicitly closes any open subpaths of the current
path. The inside of the current path is determined by the normal non-zero
winding number rule.

<A NAME="filter"></A>
<B>filter</B> LEVEL 2
<PRE>source/target param1 ... paramn name filter file</PRE>
<P>
creates and returns a filtered file.
<P>
The source/target operand specifies the underlying data source or data target
that the filter is to read or write. It can be a file, procedure, or string.
<P>
The param1 ... paramn operands are additional parameters that control how
the filter is to operate. The number and types of these operands depend
on the filter name. Most filters require no additional parameters.
<P>
The name operand identifies the data transformation that the filter is to
perform. The standard filter names are: 
<PRE>
  ASCIIHexEncode  ASCIIHexDecode 
  ASCII85Encode   ASCII85Decode 
  LZWEncode       LZWDecode 
  RunLengthEncode RunLengthDecode 
  CCITTFaxEncode  CCITTFaxDecode 
  DCTEncode       DCTDecode 
  NullEncode      SubFileDecode 
</PRE>
An encoding filter is an output (writable) file. A decoding filter is an
input (readable) file. The file object returned by the filter can be used
as an operand of normal file input and output operators, such as read and
write. Reading from an input filtered file causes the filter to read from
the underlying data source and transform the data. Similarly, writing to
an output filtered file causes the filter to transform the data and write
it to the underlying data target.

findencoding is a special case of findresource applied to the Encoding category.

<PRE>key findfont font</PRE>
<P>
obtains a font dictionary identified by the specified key and pushes it
on the operand stack . key may be a key previously passed to <A HREF="d.html#definefont">definefont</A>,
in which case the font dictionary associated with key (in the font directory)
is returned.
<P>
If key is not registered as a font in VM, findfont takes an action that
varies according to the environment in which the PostScript interpreter
is operating. In some environments, findfont may attempt to read a font
definition from an external source, such as a file. In other environments,
findfont substitutes a default font or executes the error <A HREF="ik.html#invalidfont">invalidfont</A>.
findfont is a special case of <A HREF="#findresource">findresource</A> applied
to the Font category.
<P>
findfont, like <A HREF="#findresource">findresource</A>, normally looks
first for fonts defined in local VM, then for fonts defined in global VM.
However, if the current VM allocation mode is global, findfont considers
only fonts defined in global VM. If findfont needs to load a font into VM,
it may use either local or global VM, depending on the font. Generally,
Type 1 fonts are loaded into global VM; fonts of other types are loaded
in to local VM.
<P>
findfont is not an operator, but rather a built-in procedure. It may be
redefined by a PostScript language program that requires different strategies
for finding fonts.

<HR>
<A NAME="findresource"></A>
<B>findresource</B> LEVEL 2
<PRE>key category findresource instance</PRE>
<P>
attempts to obtain a named resource instance in a specified category. category
is a name object that identifies a resource category, such as Font . key
is a name or string object that identifies the resource instance. (Names
and strings are interchangeable; other types of keys are permitted but are
not recommended.) If it succeeds, findresource pushes the resource instance
on the operand stack; this is an object whose type depends on the resource
category.
<P>
findresource first attempts to obtain a resource instance that has previously
been defined in VM by defineresource. If the current VM allocation mode
is local, findresource considers local resource definitions first, then
global definitions (see <A HREF="d.html#defineresource">defineresource</A>).
However, if the current VM allocation mode is global, findresource considers
only global resource definitions.
<P>
If the requested resource instance is not currently defined in VM, findresource
attempts to obtain it from an external source. The way this is done is not
specified by the PostScript language; it varies among different implementations
and different resource categories. The effect of this action is to create
an object in VM and execute defineresource. findresource then returns the
newly created object. If key is not a name or string, findresource will
not attempt to obtain an external resource.
<P>
When findresource loads an object into VM, it ordinarily attempts to use
global VM, regardless of the current VM allocation mode. In other words,
it sets the VM allocation mode to global (true setglobal) while loading
the resource instance and executing defineresource. However, certain resource
instances do not function correctly when loaded into global VM; findresource
uses local VM instead. This always occurs for type 3 font definitions and
for any resource instance whose definition includes an explicit false setglobal.
<P>
During its execution, findresource may remove the definitions of resource
instances that were previously loaded into VM by findresource. The mechanisms
and policies for this depend on the category and the implementation; reclamation
of resources may occur at times other than during execution of findresource.
However, resource definitions that were made by explicit execution of <A HREF="d.html#defineresource">defineresource</A>
are never disturbed by automatic reclamation.<P>
<P>
If the specified resource category does not exist, an <A HREF="u.html#undefined">undefined</A>
error occurs. If the category exists but there is no instance whose name
is key, an <A HREF="u.html#undefinedresource">undefinedresource</A>
error occurs.

contain any <A HREF="c.html#curveto">curveto</A> segments, flattenpath

<P>
This &quot;flattening&quot; of curves to straight line segments is done
automatically when a path is used to control painting (for example, by <A HREF="s.html#stroke">stroke</A>,
<A HREF="#fill">fill</A>, or <A HREF="c.html#clip">clip</A>). Only rarely
does a program need to flatten a path explicitly (see <A HREF="p.html#pathbbox">pathbbox</A>).

If file is an input file, flushfile reads and discards data from file until
the end-offile indication is encountered. This is useful during error recovery,

<A NAME="FontDirectory"></A>
<B>FontDirectory</B>
<PRE>- FontDirectory dict</PRE>
<P>
pushes a dictionary of defined fonts on the operand stack. FontDirectory
is not an operator; it is a name in systemdict associated with the dictionary
object.
<P>
The FontDirectory dictionary associates font names with font dictionaries.
definefont places entries in FontDirectory, and findfont looks there first.
The dictionary is read-only; only definefont and undefinefont can change
it.
<P>
Although FontDirectory contains all fonts that are currently defined in
VM, it does not necessarily describe all the fonts available to a PostScript
language program. This is because the findfont operator
can sometimes obtain fonts from an external source and load them into VM
dynamically. Consequently, examining FontDirectory is not a reliable method
of inquiring about available fonts. The preferred method is to use the <A HREF="qr.html#resourcestatus">resourcestatus</A>
and <A HREF="qr.html#resourceforall">resourceforall</A> operators, which
are Level 2 features, to inquire about the Font resource category.
<P>
In Level 2, when global VM allocation mode is in effect, the name FontDirectory
is temporarily
rebound to the value of GlobalFontDirectory, which contains only those fonts
that have been defined in global VM. This ensures the correct behavior of
fonts that are defined in terms of other fonts.

<A NAME="for"></A>
<B>for</B>
<PRE>initial increment limit proc for -</PRE>
<P>
executes proc repeatedly, passing it a sequence of values from initial by
steps of increment to limit. The for operator expects initial, increment,
and limit to be numbers. It maintains a temporary internal variable, known
as the control variable, which it first sets to initial. Then, before each
repetition, it compares the control variable with the termination value
limit. If limit has not been exceeded, it pushes the control variable on
the operand stack, executes proc, and adds increment to the control variable.
<P>
The termination condition depends on whether increment is positive or negative.
If increment is positive, for terminates when the control variable becomes
greater than limit. If increment is negative, for terminates when the control
variable becomes less than limit. If initial meets the termination condition,
for does not execute proc at all. If proc executes the <A HREF="e.html#exit">exit</A>
operator, for terminates prematurely.
<P>
Usually, proc will use the value on the operand stack for some purpose.
However, if proc does not remove the value, it will remain there. Successive
executions of proc will cause successive values of the control variable
to accumulate on the operand stack.
<P>
<B>Examples</B>
<PRE>
0 1 1 4 {add} for &rArr; 10
1 2 6 { } for     &rArr; 1 3 5
3 -.5 1 {} for    &rArr; 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0
</PRE>
<P>
In the first example, the value of the control variable is added to whatever
is on the stack, so 1, 2, 3, and 4 are added in turn to a running sum whose
initial value is 0. The second example has an empty procedure, so the successive
values of the control variable are left on the stack. The last example counts
backward from 3 to 1 by halves, leaving the successive values on the stack.
<P>
Beware of using reals instead of integers for any of the first three operands.
Most real numbers are not represented exactly. This can cause an error to
accumulate in the value of the control variable, with possibly surprising
results. In particular, if the difference between initial and limit is a
multiple of increment, as in the third line of the example, the control
variable may not achieve the limit value.

<P>
enumerates the elements of the first operand, executing the procedure proc
for each element. If the first operand is an array, string, or packed array,
forall pushes an element on the operand stack and executes proc for each
element in the array, string, or packed array, beginning with the element
whose index is 0 and continuing sequentially. The objects pushed on the
operand stack are the array, packed array, or string elements. In the case
of a string, these elements are integers in the range 0 to 255, not one-character
strings.
<P>
If the first operand is a dictionary, forall pushes a key and a value on
the operand stack and executes proc for each key-value pair in the dictionary.
The order in which forall enumerates the entries in the dictionary is arbitrary.
New entries put in the dictionary during execution of proc may or may not
be included in the enumeration.
<P>
If the first operand is empty (i.e., has length 0), forall does not execute
proc at all. If proc executes the <A HREF="e.html#exit">exit</A> operator,
forall terminates prematurely.
<P>
Although forall does not leave any results on the operand stack when it
is finished, the execution of proc may leave arbitrary results there. If
proc does not remove each enumerated element from the operand stack, the
elements will accumulate there.

<PRE>mark obj1 ... objn proc fork context</PRE>
<P>
creates a new execution context using the same local and global VM as the
current context. The new context begins execution concurrent with continued
execution of the current context. Which context executes first is unpredictable.
<P>
The new context's environment is formed by copying the dictionary and graphics
state stacks of the current context. The initial operand stack consists
of obj1 through objn, pushed in the same order (obj1 through objn are objects
of any type other than <A HREF="m.html#mark">mark</A>). fork consumes
all operands down to and including the topmost mark. It then pushes an integer
that uniquely identifies the new context. The forked context inherits its
object format from the current context; other percontext parameters are
initialized to default values.
<P>
When the new context begins execution, it executes the procedure proc. If
proc runs to completion and returns, the context ordinarily will suspend
until some other context executes a join on context. However, if the context
has been detached, it will terminate immediately (see <A HREF="ik.html#join">join</A>
and <A HREF="d.html#detach">detach</A>).
<P>
If proc executes a stop that causes the execution of proc to end prematurely,
the context will terminate immediately. proc is effectively called as follows:
<PRE>
proc stopped {handleerror quit} if
% ...Wait for join or detach...
quit
</PRE>
<P>
In other words, if proc stops due to an error, the context invokes the error
handler in the usual way to report the error. Then it terminates regardless
of whether it has been detached.
<P>
It is illegal to execute fork if there has been any previous save not yet
matched by a restore. Attempting to do so will cause an <A HREF="ik.html#invalidcontext">invalidcontext</A>
