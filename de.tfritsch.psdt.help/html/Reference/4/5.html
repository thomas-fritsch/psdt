	<h3>4.5 Painting</h3>
	<p>
		The painting operators mark graphical shapes on the current page. This
		section describes the principal, general-purpose painting operators, <a
			href="../8/2/s/stroke.html">stroke</a> and <a
			href="../8/2/f/fill.html">fill</a>. Variants of these operators
		combine path construction and painting in a single operation; see
		Section <a href="6.html">4.6, "User Paths."</a> More specialized
		operators include <a href="../8/2/s/shfill.html">shfill</a>, described
		in Section <a href="9/3.html">4.9.3, "Shading Patterns"</a>; <a
			href="../8/2/i/image.html">image</a>, described in Section <a
			href="10.html">4.10, "Images"</a>; and the glyph and font operators,
		described in Chapter <a href="../5.html">5</a>.
	</p>
	<p>The operators and graphics state parameters described here
		control the abstract appearance of graphical shapes and are
		device-independent. Additional, device-dependent facilities for
		controlling the rendering of graphics in raster memory are described
		in Chapter 7.</p>
