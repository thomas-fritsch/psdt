	<h3>4.8.2 Device Color Spaces</h3>
	<p>
		The device color spaces enable a page description to specify color
		values that are directly related to their representation on an output
		device. Color values in these spaces map directly&mdash;or via simple
		conversions&mdash;to the application of device colorants, such as
		quantities of ink or intensities of display phosphors. This enables a
		PostScript program to control colors precisely for a <i>particular</i>
		device, but the results may not be consistent between <i>different</i>
		devices.
	</p>
	<p>Output devices form colors either by adding light sources
		together or by subtracting light from an illuminating source. Computer
		displays and film recorders typically add colors, while printing inks
		typically subtract them. These two ways of forming colors give rise to
		two complementary forms of color specification: the additive RGB
		specification and the subtractive CMYK specification. The
		corresponding device color spaces are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>DeviceRGB</b> controls the intensities of red, green, and
			blue light, the three additive primary colors used in displays.
			Colors in this space can alternatively be specified by hue,
			saturation, and brightness values.</li>
		<li><b>DeviceCMYK</b> controls the concentrations of cyan,
			magenta, yellow, and black inks, the four subtractive process colors
			used in printing.</li>
		<li><b>DeviceGray</b> controls the intensity of achromatic light,
			on a scale from black to white.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Although the notion of explicit color spaces is a LanguageLevel 2
		feature, the operators for specifying colors in the <b>DeviceRGB</b>
		and <b>DeviceGray</b> color spaces&mdash;<a
			href="../../8/2/s/setrgbcolor.html">setrgbcolor</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/sethsbcolor.html">sethsbcolor</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setgray.html">setgray</a>&mdash;are available in
		all LanguageLevels. The <a href="../../8/2/s/setcmykcolor.html">setcmykcolor</a>
		operator is also supported by some (but not all) LanguageLevel 1
		implementations.
