	<h4>DeviceRGB Color Space</h4>
	<p>
		Colors in the <b>DeviceRGB</b> color space can be specified according
		to either of two color models: <i>red-green-blue</i> (RGB) and <i>hue-saturation-brightness</i>
		(HSB). Each of these models can specify any reproducible color with
		three numeric parameters, but the numbers have different meanings in
		the two models. Example 4.6 shows different ways to select the <b>DeviceRGB</b>
		color space and a specific color within that space.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 4.6</b>
	</p>
	<pre>[/DeviceRGB] setcolorspace <i>red green blue</i> setcolor
/DeviceRGB setcolorspace <i>red green blue</i> setcolor
<i>red green blue</i> setrgbcolor
hue saturation brightness sethsbcolor</pre>
	<p>In the RGB model, a color is described as a combination of the
		three additive primary colors (red, green, and blue) in particular
		concentrations. The intensity of each primary color is specified by a
		number in the range 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 denotes no contribution at
		all and 1.0 denotes maximum intensity of that color.</p>
	<p>If all three primary colors have equal intensity, the perceived
		result theoretically is a pure gray on the scale from black to white.
		If the intensities are not all equal, the result is some color other
		than a pure gray.</p>
	<p>
		In the HSB model, a color is described by a combination of three
		parameters called <i>hue</i>, <i>saturation</i>, and <i>brightness</i>:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Hue</i> corresponds to the property that is intuitively
			meant by the term "color," such as yellow or blue-green.</li>
		<li><i>Saturation</i> indicates how pure the color is. A
			saturation of 0.0 means that none of the color's hue is visible; the
			result is a shade of gray. A saturation of 1.0 denotes a pure color,
			consisting entirely of the specified hue. Intermediate values
			represent a mixture between pure hue and pure gray.</li>
		<li><i>Brightness</i> determines how light the color determined
			by the hue and saturation will be. A brightness of 0.0 is always
			black. A brightness of 1.0 denotes the lightest color that the given
			combination of hue and saturation can allow. (For example, pure red
			can never be as light as the brightest white, because it is missing
			two components.)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>HSB colors are often illustrated as arranged around a color
		wheel. The hue parameter determines the angular position of a color on
		this wheel, with 0.0 corresponding to pure red, 1/3 (0.333) to pure
		green, 2/3 (0.666) to pure blue, and 1.0 to red again. The saturation
		parameter denotes the color's radial position between the center of
		the wheel (saturation = 0.0) and the edge (saturation = 1.0). The
		brightness parameter controls the brightness of the colors displayed
		on the wheel itself.</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> HSB is not a color space in its own right. It is
			simply an alternative convention for specifying color values in the <b>DeviceRGB</b>
			color space.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		As shown in Example 4.6, the <a
			href="../../../8/2/s/setcolorspace.html">setcolorspace</a> and <a
			href="../../../8/2/s/setcolor.html">setcolor</a> operators select the
		color space and color value separately; <a
			href="../../../8/2/s/setrgbcolor.html">setrgbcolor</a> and <a
			href="../../../8/2/s/sethsbcolor.html">sethsbcolor</a> set them in
		combination. When the specified color space is <b>DeviceRGB</b>, <a
			href="../../../8/2/s/setcolorspace.html">setcolorspace</a> sets the
		red, green, and blue components of the current color to 0.0.
	</p>
	<p>
		When <b>DeviceRGB</b> is the current color space, both <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/currentcolor.html">currentcolor</a> and <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/currentrgbcolor.html">currentrgbcolor</a> return
		the current color value in the form of its red, green, and blue
		components, regardless of how it was originally specified. <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/currenthsbcolor.html">currenthsbcolor</a>
		returns the current color value as a hue, saturation, and brightness,
		converting among color models as necessary. When one of the other
		device color spaces (<b>DeviceCMYK</b> or <b>DeviceGray</b>) is
		current, <a href="../../../8/2/c/currentcolor.html">currentcolor</a>
		returns the current color value expressed in that space; <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/currentrgbcolor.html">currentrgbcolor</a> and <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/currenthsbcolor.html">currenthsbcolor</a>
		convert it to <b>DeviceRGB</b>. (The conversions are described in
		Section <a href="../../../7/2.html">7.2, "Conversions among Device
			Color Spaces."</a>) These operators cannot convert from CIE-based or
		special color spaces.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Of the operators just described, only <a
			href="../../../8/2/s/setrgbcolor.html">setrgbcolor</a>, <a
			href="../../../8/2/s/sethsbcolor.html">sethsbcolor</a>, <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/currentrgbcolor.html">currentrgbcolor</a>, and <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/currenthsbcolor.html">currenthsbcolor</a> are
			supported in LanguageLevel 1.</i>
