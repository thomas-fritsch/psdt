	<h3>4.8 Color Spaces</h3>
	<p>The PostScript language includes powerful facilities for
		specifying the colors of graphical objects to be marked on the current
		page. The color facilities are divided into two parts:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Color specification.</i> A PostScript program can specify
			abstract colors in a device-independent way. Colors can be described
			in any of a variety of color systems, or color spaces. Some color
			spaces are related to device color representation (grayscale, RGB,
			CMYK), others to human visual perception (CIE-based). Certain special
			features are also modeled as color spaces: patterns, color mapping,
			separations, and high-fidelity and multitone color.</li>
		<li><i>Color rendering.</i> The PostScript interpreter reproduces
			colors on the raster output device by a multiple-step process that
			includes color conversion, gamma correction, halftoning, and scan
			conversion. Certain aspects of this process are under PostScript
			language control. However, unlike the facilities for color
			specification, the color rendering facilities are device-dependent
			and ordinarily should not be accessed from a page description.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This section describes the color specification facilities of the
		PostScript language. It covers everything that most PostScript
		programs need in order to specify colors. Chapter <a href="../7.html">7</a>
		describes the facilities for controlling color rendering; a program
		should use those facilities only to configure or calibrate an output
		device or to achieve special device-dependent effects.
	</p>
	<p>Figures 4.5 and 4.6 on pages 212 and 213 illustrate the
		organization of the Post- Script language features for dealing with
		color, showing the division between (device-independent) color
		specification and (device-dependent) color rendering.</p>
