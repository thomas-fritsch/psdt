	<h3>4.7 Forms</h3>
	<p>
		A <i>form</i> is a self-contained description of any arbitrary
		graphics, text, or sampled images that are to be painted multiple
		times, either on several pages or at several locations on the same
		page. The appearance of a form is described by a PostScript procedure
		that invokes graphics operators. Language support for forms is a
		LanguageLevel 2 feature.
	</p>
	<p>What distinguishes a form from an ordinary procedure is that it
		is self-contained and behaves according to certain rules. By defining
		a form, a program declares that each execution of the form will
		produce the same output, which depends only on the graphics state at
		the time the form is executed. The form's definition does not refer to
		variable information in virtual memory, and its execution has no side
		effects in VM.</p>
	<p>These rules permit the PostScript interpreter to save the
		graphical output of the form in a cache. Later, when the same form is
		used again, the interpreter substitutes the saved output instead of
		reexecuting the form's definition. This can significantly improve
		performance when the form is used many times.</p>
	<p>There are various uses for forms:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>As its name suggests, a form can serve as the template for an
			entire page. For example, a program that prints filled-in tax forms
			can first paint the fixed template as a form, then paint the variable
			information on top of it.</li>
		<li>A form can also be any graphical element that is to be used
			repeatedly. For example, in output from computer-aided design
			systems, it is common for certain standard components to appear many
			times. A company's logo can be treated as a form.</li>
	</ul>
