	<h3>4.10.1 Image Parameters</h3>
	<p>The properties of an image&mdash;resolution, orientation,
		scanning order, and so forth&mdash;are entirely independent of the
		characteristics of the raster output device on which the image is to
		be rendered. The PostScript interpreter usually renders images by a
		sampling and halftoning technique that attempts to approximate the
		color values of the source as accurately as possible. The actual
		accuracy achieved depends on the resolution and other properties of
		the output device.</p>
	<p>To paint an image, a PostScript program must specify four
		interrelated items:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The format of the source image: number of columns (width),
			number of rows (height), number of color components per sample, and
			number of bits per color component</li>
		<li>A data source capable of providing the image's sample data,
			which consists of <i>height</i> &times; <i>width</i> &times; <i>components</i>
			&times; <i>bits/component</i> bits of information
		</li>
		<li>The correspondence between coordinates in user space and
			coordinates in the source image space, defining the region of user
			space that will receive the image</li>
		<li>The mapping from component values in the source image to
			component values in the current color space</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The PostScript program entirely controls these four aspects of
		image specification.</p>
