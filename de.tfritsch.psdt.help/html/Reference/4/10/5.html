	<h3>4.10.5 Image Dictionaries</h3>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> operators (but not <a
			href="../../8/2/c/colorimage.html">colorimage</a>) have a one-operand
		form <i>(LanguageLevel 2)</i> in which all imaging parameters are
		bundled together in an image dictionary. This arrangement provides
		more flexibility than the five-operand form of <a
			href="../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> or any form of <a
			href="../../8/2/c/colorimage.html">colorimage</a>. The following
		features are available only by means of image dictionaries:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Use of arbitrary color spaces, such as <b>CIEBasedABC</b> or
			<b>Separation</b> spaces
		</li>
		<li>User-defined decoding of image sample values
		<li>Interpolation between samples</li>
		<li>Explicit masking and color key masking <i>(LanguageLevel
				3)</i></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Every image dictionary contains an entry named <b>ImageType</b>, which
		indicates the general organization of the dictionary and the type of
		image it represents. The most straightforward are type 1 dictionaries
		<i>(LanguageLevel 2)</i>. When used with the <a
			href="../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator, type 1 defines an
		opaque rectangular image to be painted in its entirety, completely
		overlaying any previous marks already existing on the page. Two more
		image types, 3 and 4 <i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i>, represent masked
		images. Images of these types may include transparent areas, allowing
		previously existing marks to show through. Type 3 and 4 image
		dictionaries are discussed in Section <a href="6.html">4.10.6,
			"Masked Images."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Type 1 dictionaries can be used with the <a
			href="../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> operator to achieve a
			form of transparent masking known as stencil masking. They are
			subject to certain restrictions when used in this way, however, as
			detailed below.</i>
