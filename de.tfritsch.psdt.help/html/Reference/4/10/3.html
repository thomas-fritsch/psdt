	<h3>4.10.3 Source Coordinate System</h3>
	<p>
		The image operators impose a coordinate system on the source image.
		They consider the source image to be a rectangle <i>h</i> units high
		and <i>w</i> units wide. Each sample occupies one square unit. The
		origin (0, 0) is in the lower-left corner, with coordinates ranging
		from 0 to <i>w</i> horizontally and 0 to <i>h</i> vertically.
	</p>
	<p>
		The image operators assume that the sample data they receive from
		their data source is ordered by row, with the horizontal coordinate
		varying most rapidly. The lower-left corner of the first sample is at
		coordinates (0, 0), the second at (1, 0), and so on through the last
		sample of the first row, whose lower-left corner is at (<i>w</i> - 1,
		0) and whose lower-right corner is at (<i>w</i>, 0). The next samples
		after that are at coordinates (0, 1), (1, 1), and so on, until the
		final sample of the image, whose lower-left corner is at (<i>w</i> -
		1, <i>h</i> - 1) and whose upper-right corner is at (<i>w</i>, <i>h</i>).
		Figure 4.23 illustrates the organization of the source coordinate
		system. The numbers inside the squares indicate the order of the
		samples, counting from 0.

	<p>The source coordinate system and scanning order imposed by the
		image operators do not preclude using different conventions in the
		actual source image. Coordinate transformation can be used to map
		other conventions into the PostScript convention.</p>
	<p>
		The correspondence between this source image coordinate system (or <i>image
			space</i>) and user space is specified by a special matrix. This is a
		general linear transformation that defines a mapping from user space
		to image space; that is, it transforms user space coordinates to the
		corresponding coordinates in image space. It can include translation,
		rotation, reflection, and shearing (see Section <a href="../3.html">4.3,
			"Coordinate Systems and Transformations"</a>). The matrix is provided in
		one of two ways:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the five-operand forms of <a href="../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a>
			and <a href="../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> and in all
			forms of <a href="../../8/2/c/colorimage.html">colorimage</a>, there
			is a separate matrix operand.
		</li>
		<li>In image dictionaries, there is a required <b>ImageMatrix</b>
			entry.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Although it is possible to map directly from current user space
		to image space by defining the image matrix appropriately, it is
		easier to think about the transformation by dividing it into two
		stages (see Figure 4.24):</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The image matrix maps the unit square of user space, bounded
			by user coordinates (0, 0) and (1, 1), to the boundary of the source
			image in image space.</li>
		<li>The current transformation matrix (CTM) maps the unit square
			of user space to the rectangle or parallelogram on the page that is
			to receive the image.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This is just a convention, but it is a useful one that is
		recommended. Under this convention, the image matrix is used solely to
		describe the image itself, independently of how it is to be
		positioned, oriented, and scaled on a particular page. It defines an
		idealized image space consisting of a unit square that conforms to
		PostScript conventions for coordinate system and scanning order. A
		program can then map this idealized image space into current user
		space by altering the CTM in straightforward ways.</p>

	<p>An image that happens to use the PostScript conventions
		(scanning from left to right and bottom to top) can be described by
		the image matrix</p>
	<pre>[<i>w</i> 0 0 <i>h</i> 0 0]</pre>
	<p>
		(where <i>w</i> and <i>h</i> are the width and height of the image,
		respectively). An image that is scanned from left to right and top to
		bottom (a commonly used order) is described by the image matrix
	</p>
	<pre>[<i>w</i> 0 0 -<i>h</i> 0 <i>h</i>]</pre>
	<p>Images scanned in other common orders can be described in
		similar ways.</p>
	<p>
		An image that has been mapped into the unit square in this way can
		then be placed on the output page in the desired position,
		orientation, and size by invoking PostScript operators that transform
		user space: <a href="../../8/2/t/translate.html">translate</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/rotate.html">rotate</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/s/scale.html">scale</a>. For example, to map such an
		image into a rectangle whose lower-left corner is at coordinates (100,
		200), that is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise, and that is 150
		units wide and 80 high, a program can execute
	</p>
	<pre>100 200 translate
45 rotate
150 80 scale</pre>
	<p>
		before invoking the <a href="../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/c/colorimage.html">colorimage</a>, or <a
			href="../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> operator. This works
		for any image that has been mapped into the unit square by an
		appropriate image matrix. Of course, if the aspect ratio (width to
		height) of the source image in this example were different from
		150:80, the result would be distorted.
