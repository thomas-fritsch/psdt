	<h3>4.10.2 Sample Representation</h3>
	<p>
		The source format for an image can be described by four parameters: <i>width</i>,
		<i>height</i>, <i>components</i>, and <i>bits/component</i>. A
		PostScript program specifies <i>width</i>, <i>height</i>, and <i>bits/component</i>
		explicitly. The interpreter infers the components parameter as
		follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>With the five-operand form of the <a
			href="../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator and with <a
			href="../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a>, components is always
			1.
		</li>
		<li>With the one-operand (image dictionary) form of the <a
			href="../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator, <i>components</i>
			is the number of components in the current color space (see Section <a
			href="../8.html">4.8, "Color Spaces"</a>).
		</li>
		<li>With the <a href="../../8/2/c/colorimage.html">colorimage</a>
			operator, <i>components</i> is specified explicitly as the <i>ncomp</i>
			operand.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Sample data is represented as a stream of bytes, interpreted as 8-bit
		integers in the range 0 to 255, obtained from some data source (either
		returned from a procedure or read from a file or string). The bytes
		constitute a continuous bit stream, with the high-order bit of each
		byte first. This bit stream is in turn divided into units of <i>bits/component</i>
		bits each, ignoring byte boundaries. Sample values of 12 bits straddle
		byte boundaries; other sizes never do. Each unit encodes a color
		component value, given with the high-order bit first.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Each row of the source image begins on a byte boundary.</i> If the
		number of data bits per row is not a multiple of 8, the end of the row
		must be padded with extra bits to fill out the last byte. The
		PostScript interpreter ignores these padding bits.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each source sample component is interpreted as an integer in the range
		0 to 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> - 1, where n is the number of bits per
		component. The PostScript interpreter maps this to a color component
		value (equivalent to what could be used with operators such as <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setgray.html">setgray</a> or <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setcolor.html">setcolor</a>) by one of two methods:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>With the five-operand form of <a
			href="../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a>, and with all forms of <a
			href="../../8/2/c/colorimage.html">colorimage</a>, the integer 0 maps
			to the number 0.0, the integer 2n - 1 maps to the number 1.0, and
			intermediate values map linearly to numbers between 0.0 to 1.0.
		</li>
		<li>With the one-operand (dictionary) form of <a
			href="../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a>, the mapping is specified
			explicitly by the Decode entry in the image dictionary.
		</li>
		<li>With <a href="../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a>,
			image samples do not represent color values, so mapping is not
			relevant (see Section <a href="6.html">4.10.6, "Masked Images"</a>).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The imaging operators (<a href="../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/c/colorimage.html">colorimage</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a>) can obtain sample
		data from any of three types of object:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Procedure.</i> Whenever the interpreter requires
			additional sample data, it calls the procedure, which is expected to
			return a string containing some more data. The amount of data
			returned by each call is arbitrary. However, returning one or more
			complete rows at a time simplifies programming, especially when
			reading image data that appears in-line in a PostScript program. This
			is the only type of data source permitted in LanguageLevel 1.</li>
		<li><i>File</i>. The interpreter simply reads data from the file
			as necessary. Note that the file can be filtered to perform some kind
			of decoding or decompression (see Section <a href="../../3/8/4.html">
				3.8.4, "Filters"</a>). This type of data source is a LanguageLevel 2
			feature.</li>
		<li><i>String.</i> The interpreter simply reads data from the
			string, reusing the string as many times as necessary to satisfy the
			needs of the imaging operation. This type of data source is a
			LanguageLevel 2 feature, though equivalent behavior can be obtained
			in LanguageLevel 1 by providing a procedure that simply returns the
			same string each time it is called.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Data sources for images are much the same as those for filters; for
		further elaboration on their semantics, see <a
			href="../../3/13/1.html">Section 3.13.1, "Data Sources and
			Targets."</a> When reading from a data source causes a PostScript
		procedure to be invoked, that procedure must not do anything to
		disturb the ongoing imaging operation, such as alter the graphics
		state or image dictionary or initiate a new imaging operation.
	</p>
	<p>A data source can end prematurely. This occurs if a procedure
		returns a zero-length string or a file encounters end-of-file. If a
		data source ends before all samples have been read, the remainder of
		the image that would have been painted by the missing samples is left
		unpainted. If the last source row is incomplete&mdash;that is, if the
		data source ends in the middle of a row&mdash;the partial source row
		may be discarded and not painted.</p>
	<p>When there are multiple color components per sample (the value
		of components is greater than 1), the source data can be organized in
		either of two ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Single data source.</i> All color components are obtained
			from the same source, interleaved sample by sample. For example, in a
			three-component RGB image, the red, green, and blue components for
			one sample are followed by the red, green, and blue components for
			the next sample.</li>
		<li><i>Multiple data sources.</i> Each color component is
			obtained from a separate source&mdash;for example, all red components
			from one source, all green components from a second, and all blue
			components from a third. If the data sources are strings, they must
			all be of the same length. If they are procedures, they must all
			return strings of the same length on any given call. The interpreter
			calls each procedure in turn, in the order in which they are
			specified as operands to the <a href="../../8/2/c/colorimage.html">colorimage</a>
			operator or in which they appear in the image dictionary's <b>DataSource</b>
			array. The procedures may read data from the same file, but they must
			return their results in separate strings, since the interpreter does
			not copy this data elsewhere in the course of assembling the values
			for a single sequence of samples. If the data sources are files, the
			interpreter may read unpredictable amounts of data from them in
			unpredictable orders, so they must be completely independent of each
			other&mdash;that is, they must not be the same file, nor filters that
			ultimately read from the same file.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		A PostScript program specifies which organization to use by means of
		the <i>multi</i> operand of the <a href="../../8/2/c/colorimage.html">colorimage</a>
		operator or the <b>MultipleDataSources</b> entry in the image
		dictionary. Figure 4.22 illustrates some typical organizations for
		data sources. It also shows the image sample decoding operation.
