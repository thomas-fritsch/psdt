	<h4>Image Interpolation</h4>
	<p>
		When the resolution of a source image is significantly lower than that
		of the output device, each source sample covers many device pixels.
		This can cause images to appear "jaggy" or "blocky." These visual
		artifacts can be reduced by applying an image interpolation algorithm
		during rendering. Instead of painting all pixels covered by a source
		sample with the same color, image interpolation attempts to produce a
		smooth transition between adjacent sample values. Because it may
		increase the time required to render the image, image interpolation is
		disabled by default; setting the <b>Interpolate</b> entry in the image
		dictionary to true for either <a href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a>
		or <a href="../../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> enables it.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The interpolation algorithm is
			implementation-dependent and not under PostScript program control.
			Image interpolation may not always be performed for some classes of
			image or on some output devices.</i>
