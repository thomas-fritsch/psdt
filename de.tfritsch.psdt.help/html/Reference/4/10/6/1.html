	<h4>Stencil Masking</h4>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> operator
		operates on a monochrome image, in which each sample is specified by a
		single bit. However, instead of painting the image in opaque black and
		white, <a href="../../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> treats it
		as a stencil mask that is partly opaque and partly transparent. Sample
		values in the image do not represent black and white pixels; rather,
		they designate places on the page that should either be marked with
		the current color or masked out (not marked at all). Areas that are
		masked out retain their former contents. The effect is like applying
		paint in the current color through a cut-out stencil: a sample value
		of 1 in the image permits the paint to reach the page and a 0 masks it
		out, or vice versa.
	</p>
	<p>
		A program invokes <a href="../../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a>
		in much the same way as <a href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a>;
		most of the parameters have equivalent meanings. As with <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a>, there is a five-operand
		form available in all LanguageLevels and a one-operand image
		dictionary form that is a LanguageLevel 2 feature. <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> differs from <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> in the following
		significant ways:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The number of components per sample is always 1, regardless
			of the current color space, because sample values represent masking
			properties rather than colors.</li>
		<li>The number of bits per component is always 1. In its
			five-operand form, <a href="../../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a>
			has no <i>bits/sample</i> operand; in the one-operand (image
			dictionary) form, the dictionary's <b>BitsPerComponent</b> value must
			be 1.
		</li>
		<li>The five-operand form of <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> includes a <i>polarity</i>
			operand that determines how the source samples are to be interpreted.
			If <i>polarity</i> is <i>true</i>, a sample value of 1 designates a
			painted sample and 0 designates a masked (unpainted) sample; if <i>false</i>,
			these meanings are reversed. The one-operand form of <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> uses the <b>Decode</b>
			entry in the image dictionary for the same purpose: <b>Decode</b>
			arrays of [1 0] and [0 1] correspond to <i>polarity</i> values of <i>true</i>
			and <i>false</i>, respectively.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		One of the most important uses of stencil masking is for painting
		character glyphs represented as bitmaps. Using such a glyph as a
		stencil mask transfers only its "black" bits to the page, while
		leaving the "white" bits (which are really just background) unchanged.
		For reasons discussed in Section <a href="../../../5/5.html">5.5,
			"Font Cache,"</a> <a href="../../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a>
		rather than <a href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> should
		almost always be used to paint glyph bitmaps.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> If image interpolation is requested during stencil
			masking, the effect is to smooth the edges of the mask, not to
			interpolate the painted color values (see <a href="../5/3.html">"Image
				Interpolation" on page 301</a>). This can minimize the “jaggy”
			appearance of a low-resolution stencil mask.</i>
