	<h3>4.3.3 Matrix Representation and Manipulation</h3>
	<p>This section presents a brief introduction to the representation
		and manipulation of matrices. Some knowledge of this topic will make
		the descriptions of the coordinate system and matrix operators in
		Chapter 8 easier to understand. It is not essential to understand the
		details of matrix arithmetic on first reading, but only to obtain a
		clear geometrical model of the effects of the various transformations.</p>
	<p>A two-dimensional transformation is described mathematically by
		a 3-by-3 matrix:</p>
	<pre>
| <i>a  b</i>  0 |
| <i>c  d</i>  0 |
| <i>t<sub>x</sub> t<sub>y</sub></i>  1 |</pre>
	<p>In the PostScript language, this matrix is represented as a
		six-element array object</p>
	<pre>[<i>a b c d t<sub>x</sub> t<sub>y</sub></i>]</pre>
	<p>omitting the matrix elements in the third column, which always
		have constant values.</p>
	<p>
		This matrix transforms a coordinate pair (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) into
		another coordinate pair (<i>x'</i>, <i>y'</i>) according to the linear
		equations
	</p>
	<pre>
<i>x'</i> = <i>ax</i> + <i>cy</i> + <i>t<sub>x</sub></i>
<i>y'</i> = <i>bx</i> + <i>dy</i> + <i>t<sub>y</sub></i>	</pre>
	<p>
		The common transformations are easily described in this matrix
		notation. Translation by a specified displacement (<i>t<sub>x</sub></i>,
		<i>t<sub>y</sub></i>) is described by the matrix
	</p>
	<pre>
| 1  0  0 |
| 0  1  0 |
| <i>t<sub>x</sub> t<sub>y</sub></i>  1 |</pre>
	<p>
		Scaling by the factor <i>s<sub>x</sub></i> in the horizontal dimension
		and <i>s<sub>y</sub></i> in the vertical dimension is accomplished by
		the matrix
	</p>
	<pre>
| <i>s<sub>x</sub></i>  0  0 |
| 0  <i>s<sub>y</sub></i>  0 |
| 0  0   1 |</pre>
	<p>
		Rotation counterclockwise about the origin by an angle <i>&theta;</i>
		is described by the matrix
	</p>
	<pre>
|  cos<i>&theta;</i>  sin<i>&theta;</i>  0 |
| -sin<i>&theta;</i>  cos<i>&theta;</i>  0 |
|    0     0   1 |</pre>
	<p>Figure 4.2 illustrates the effects of these common
		transformations</p>

	<p>A PostScript program can describe any desired transformation as
		a sequence of these operations performed in some order. An important
		property of the matrix notation is that a program can concatenate a
		sequence of operations to form a single matrix that embodies all of
		them in combination. That is, transforming any pair of coordinates by
		the single concatenated matrix produces the same result as
		transforming them by all of the original matrices in sequence. Any
		linear transformation from user space to device space can be described
		by a single transformation matrix, the CTM.</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Concatenation is performed by matrix
			multiplication. The order in which transformations are concatenated
			is significant (technically, matrix operations are associative, but
			not commutative). The requirement that matrices conform during
			multiplication is what leads to the use of 3-by-3 matrices.
			Otherwise, 2-by-3 matrices would suffice to describe transformations.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		The operators <a href="../../8/2/t/translate.html">translate</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/scale.html>scale</a>,
		and <a href="../../8/2/r/rotate.html">rotate</a>
		each concatenate the CTM with a matrix describing the desired
		transformation, producing a new matrix that combines the original and
		additional transformations. This matrix is then established as the new
		CTM:
	</p>
	<pre>
<i>newCTM = transformation</i> &times; <i>originalCTM</i></pre>
	<p>
		It is sometimes necessary to perform the <i>inverse</i> of a
		transformation&mdash;that is, to find the user space coordinates that
		correspond to a specific pair of device space coordinates. PostScript
		programs explicitly do this only occasionally, but it occurs commonly
		in the PostScript interpreter itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not all transformations are invertible in the way just described. For
		example, if a matrix contains <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>
		elements that are all 0, all user coordinates map to the same device
		coordinates and there is no unique inverse transformation. Such
		noninvertible transformations are not very useful and generally arise
		from unintentional operations, such as scaling by 0. A noninvertible
		CTM can sometimes cause an <a href="../../8/2/u/undefinedresult.html">undefinedresult</a>
		error to occur during the execution of graphics and font operators.
