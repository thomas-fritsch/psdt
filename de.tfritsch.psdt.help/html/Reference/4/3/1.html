	<h3>4.3.1 User Space and Device Space</h3>
	<p>
		Coordinates specified in a PostScript program refer to locations
		within a coordinate system that always bears the same relationship to
		the current page, regardless of the output device on which printing or
		displaying will be done. This coordinate system is called <i>user
			space</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Output devices vary greatly in the built-in coordinate systems they
		use to address pixels within their imageable areas. A particular
		device's coordinate system is a <i>device space</i>. A device space <i>origin</i>
		can be anywhere on the output page. This is because the paper moves
		through different printers and imagesetters in different directions.
		On displays, the origin can vary depending on the window system.
		Different devices have different resolutions. Some devices even have
		resolutions that are different in the horizontal and vertical
		directions.
	</p>
	<p>The operands of the path operators are coordinates expressed in
		user space. The PostScript interpreter automatically transforms user
		space coordinates into device space. For the most part, this
		transformation is hidden from the PostScript program. A program must
		consider device space only rarely, for certain special effects. This
		independence of user space from device space is essential to the
		device-independent nature of PostScript page descriptions.</p>
	<p>A coordinate system can be defined with respect to the current
		page by stating:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The location of the origin</li>
		<li>The orientation of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes
		</li>
		<li>The lengths of the units along each axis</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Initially, the user space origin is located at the lower-left corner
		of the output page or display window, with the positive <i>x</i> axis
		extending horizontally to the right and the positive <i>y</i> axis
		extending vertically upward, as in standard mathematical practice. The
		length of a unit along both the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes is 1/72
		inch. This coordinate system is the default user space. In default
		user space, all points within the current page have positive <i>x</i>
		and <i>y</i> coordinate values.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The default unit size (1/72 inch) is approximately
			the same as a "point," a unit widely used in the printing industry.
			It is not exactly the same as a point, however; there is no universal
			definition of a point.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		The default user space origin coincides with the lower-left corner of
		the <i>physical</i> page. Portions of the physical page may not be
		imageable on certain output devices. For example, many laser printers
		cannot place marks at the extreme edges of their physical page areas.
		It may not be possible to place marks at or near the default user
		space origin. The physical correspondence of page corner to default
		origin ensures that marks within the imageable portion of the output
		page will be consistently positioned with respect to the edges of the
		page.
	</p>
	<p>
		Coordinates in user space may be specified as either integers or real
		numbers. Therefore, <i>the unit size in default user space does
			not constrain locations to any arbitrary grid</i>. The resolution of
		coordinates in user space is not related in any way to the resolution
		of pixels in device space.
	</p>
	<p>
		The default user space provides a consistent, dependable starting
		place for PostScript programs regardless of the output device used. If
		necessary, the PostScript program may then modify user space to be
		more suitable to its needs by applying <i>coordinate
			transformation operators</i>, such as <a
			href="../../8/2/t/translate.html">translate</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/rotate.html">rotate</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/s/scale.html">scale</a>.
	</p>
	<p>What may appear to be absolute coordinates in a PostScript
		program are not absolute with respect to the current page, because
		they are expressed in a coordinate system that may slide around and
		shrink or expand. Coordinate system transformation not only enhances
		device independence but is a useful tool in its own right. For
		example, a page description originally composed to occupy an entire
		page can be incorporated without change as an element of another page
		description by shrinking the coordinate system in which it is drawn.</p>
	<p>
		Conceptually, user space is an infinite plane. Only a small portion of
		this plane corresponds to the imageable area of the output device: a
		rectangular area above and to the right of the origin in default user
		space. The actual size and position of the area is device- and
		media-dependent. An application can request a particular page size or
		other media properties by using the LanguageLevel 2 operator <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>, described in
		Section <a href="../../6/1/1.html">6.1.1, "Page Device
			Dictionary."</a>
