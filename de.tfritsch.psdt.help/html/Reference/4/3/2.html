	<h3>4.3.2 Transformations</h3>
	<p>
		A transformation matrix specifies how to transform the coordinate
		pairs of one coordinate space into another coordinate space. The
		graphics state includes the <i>current transformation matrix</i>
		(CTM), which describes the transformation from user space to device
		space.
	</p>
	<p>
		The elements of a matrix specify the coefficients of a pair of linear
		equations that transform the values of coordinates <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.
		However, in graphical applications, matrices are not often thought of
		in this abstract mathematical way. Instead, a matrix is considered to
		capture some sequence of geometric manipulations: translation,
		rotation, scaling, reflection, and so forth. Most of the PostScript
		language's matrix operators are organized according to this latter
		model.
	</p>
	<p>The most commonly used matrix operators are those that modify
		the current transformation matrix in the graphics state. Instead of
		creating a new transformation matrix from nothing, these operators
		change the existing transformation matrix in some specific way.
		Operators that modify user space include the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/t/translate.html">translate</a> moves the
			user space origin to a new position with respect to the current page,
			leaving the orientation of the axes and the unit lengths unchanged.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/r/rotate.html">rotate</a> turns the user
			space axes about the current user space origin by some angle, leaving
			the origin location and unit lengths unchanged.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/s/scale.html">scale</a> modifies the unit
			lengths independently along the current <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes,
			leaving the origin location and the orientation of the axes
			unchanged.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/concat.html">concat</a> applies an
			arbitrary linear transformation to the user coordinate system.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Such modifications have a variety of uses:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Changing the user coordinate system conventions for an
				entire page.</i> For example, in some applications it might be
			convenient to express user coordinates in centimeters rather than in
			72nds of an inch, or it might be convenient to have the origin in the
			center of the page rather than in the lower-left corner.</li>
		<li><i>Defining each graphical element of a page in its own
				coordinate system,</i> independent of any other element. The program can
			then position, orient, and scale each element to the desired location
			on the page by temporarily modifying the user coordinate system. This
			allows the description of an element to be decoupled from its
			placement on the page.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Example 4.1 may aid in understanding the second type of
		modification. Comments explain what each operator does.</p>

		<b>Example 4.1</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
/box             % Define a procedure to construct a unit-square path in the
  { newpath      % current user coordinate system, with its lower-left corner at
    0 0 moveto   % the origin.
    0 1 lineto
    1 1 lineto
    1 0 lineto
    closepath
  } def
gsave            % Save the current graphics state and create a new one that we
                 % can modify.
72 72 scale      % Modify the current transformation matrix so that everything
                 % subsequently drawn will be 72 times larger; that is, each unit
                 % will represent an inch instead of 1‚ÅÑ72 inch.
box fill         % Draw a unit square with its lower-left corner at the origin and
                 % fill it with black. Because the unit size is now 1 inch, this box
                 % is 1 inch on a side.
2 2 translate    % Change the transformation matrix again so that the origin is
                 % displaced 2 inches in from the left and bottom edges of the
                 % page.
box fill         % Draw the box again. This box has its lower-left corner 2 inches
                 % up from and 2 inches to the right of the lower-left corner of
                 % the page.
grestore         % Restore the saved graphics state. Now we are back to default
                 % user space.</pre>

	<p>
		Figure 4.1 is a reduction of the entire page containing the two
		squares painted by Example 4.1, along with scales indicating <i>x</i>
		and <i>y</i> positions in inches. This shows how coordinates, such as
		the ones given to the <a href="../../8/2/m/move.html">moveto</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/l/lineto.html">lineto</a> graphics operators, are
		transformed by the current transformation matrix. By combining
		translation, scaling, and rotation, very simple prototype graphics
		procedures&mdash;such as box in the example&mdash;can be used to
		generate an infinite variety of instances.
