	<h3>4.7.1 Using Forms</h3>
	<p>The use of forms requires two steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><i>Describe the appearance of the form.</i> Create a form
			dictionary containing descriptive information about the form. A
			crucial element of the dictionary is the PaintProc procedure, a
			PostScript procedure that can be executed to paint the form.</li>
		<li><i>Invoke the form.</i> Invoke the <a
			href="../../8/2/e/execform.html">execform</a> operator with the form
			dictionary as the operand. Before doing so, a program should set
			appropriate parameters in the graphics state; in particular, it
			should alter the current transformation matrix to control the
			position, size, and orientation of the form in user space.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Every form dictionary must contain a <b>FormType</b> entry, which
		identifies the particular <i>form type</i> that the dictionary
		describes and determines the format and meaning of its remaining
		entries. At the time of publication, only one form type, type 1, has
		been defined. Table 4.4 shows the contents of the form dictionary for
		this form type. (The dictionary can also contain any additional
		entries that its <b>PaintProc</b> procedure may require.)
	</p>
	<table>
		<caption>TABLE 4.4 Entries in a type 1 form dictionary</caption>
		<tr>
			<th>Key</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr id="FormType">
			<th>FormType</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Required)</i> A code identifying the form type that this
				dictionary describes. The only valid value defined at the time of
				publication is 1.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="XUID">
			<th>XUID</th>
			<td>array</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> An <i>extended unique ID</i> that uniquely
				identifies the form (see Section <a href="../../5/6/2.html">
					5.6.2, "Extended Unique ID Numbers"</a>). The presence of an <b>XUID</b>
				entry in a form dictionary enables the PostScript interpreter to
				save cached output from the form for later use, even when the form
				dictionary is loaded into virtual memory multiple times (for
				instance, by different jobs). To ensure correct behavior, <b>XUID</b>
				values must be assigned from a central registry. This is
				particularly appropriate for forms treated as named resources. Forms
				that are created dynamically by an application program should not
				contain <b>XUID</b> entries.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="BBox">
			<th>BBox</th>
			<td>array</td>
			<td><i>(Required)</i> An array of four numbers in the form
				coordinate system, giving the coordinates of the left, bottom,
				right, and top edges, respectively, of the form's bounding box.
				These boundaries are used to clip the form and to determine its size
				for caching.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="Matrix">
			<th>Matrix</th>
			<td>matrix</td>
			<td><i>(Required)</i> A transformation matrix that maps the
				form's coordinate space into user space. This matrix is concatenated
				with the current transformation matrix before the PaintProc
				procedure is called.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="PaintProc">
			<th>PaintProc</th>
			<td>procedure</td>
			<td><i>(Required)</i> A PostScript procedure for painting the
				form.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="Implementation">
			<th>Implementation</th>
			<td>any</td>
			<td>An additional entry inserted in the dictionary by the <a
				href="../../8/2/e/execform.html">execform</a> operator, containing
				information used by the interpreter to support form caching. The
				type and value of this entry are implementation-dependent.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>
		The form is defined in its own <i>form coordinate system</i>, defined
		by concatenating the matrix specified by the form dictionary's <b>Matrix</b>
		entry with the current transformation matrix each time the <a
			href="../../8/2/e/execform.html">execform</a> operator is executed.
		The form dictionary's <b>BBox</b> value is interpreted in the form
		coordinate system, and the <b>PaintProc</b> procedure is executed
		within that coordinate system.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/e/execform.html">execform</a> operator first
		checks whether the form dictionary has previously been used as an
		operand to <a href="../../8/2/e/execform.html">execform</a>. If not,
		it verifies that the dictionary contains the required elements and
		makes the dictionary read-only. It then paints the form, either by
		invoking the form's <b>PaintProc</b> procedure or by substituting
		cached output produced by a previous execution of the same form.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever <a href="../../8/2/e/execform.html">execform</a> needs to
		execute the form definition, it does the following:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Invokes <a href="../../8/2/g/gsave.html">gsave</a></li>
		<li>Concatenates the matrix from the form dictionary's <b>Matrix</b>
			entry with the CTM
		</li>
		<li>Clips according to the <b>BBox</b> entry
		</li>
		<li>Invokes <a href="../../8/2/n/newpath.html">newpath</a></li>
		<li>Pushes the form dictionary on the operand stack</li>
		<li>Executes the form's <b>PaintProc</b> procedure
		</li>
		<li>Invokes <a href="../../8/2/g/gsave.html">grestore</a></li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The <b>PaintProc</b> procedure is expected to consume its dictionary
		operand and to use the information at hand to paint the form. It must
		obey certain guidelines to avoid disrupting the environment in which
		it is executed:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It should not invoke any of the operators listed in Appendix
			G as unsuitable for use in encapsulated PostScript files.</li>
		<li>It should not invoke <a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a>,
			<a href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a>, or any device setup
			operator.
		</li>
		<li>Except for removing its dictionary operand, it should leave
			the stacks unchanged.</li>
		<li>It should have no side effects beyond painting the form. It
			should not alter objects in virtual memory or anywhere else. Because
			of the effects of caching, the <b>PaintProc</b> procedure is called
			at unpredictable times and in unpredictable environments. It should
			depend only on information in the form dictionary and should produce
			the same effect every time it is called.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Form caching is most effective when the graphics state does not change
		between successive invocations of <a href="../../8/2/e/execform.html">execform</a>
		for a given form. Changes to the translation components of the CTM
		usually do not influence caching behavior; other changes may require
		the interpreter to reexecute the <b>PaintProc</b> procedure.
