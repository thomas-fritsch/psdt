	<h3>4.4 Path Construction</h3>
	<p>
		In the PostScript language, <i>paths</i> define shapes, trajectories,
		and regions of all sorts. Programs use paths to draw lines, define the
		shapes of filled areas, and specify boundaries for clipping other
		graphics.
	</p>
	<p>A path is composed of straight and curved line segments, which
		may connect to one another or may be disconnected. A pair of segments
		are said to connect only if they are defined consecutively, with the
		second segment starting where the first one ends. Thus the order in
		which the segments of a path are defined is significant.
		Nonconsecutive segments that meet or intersect fortuitously are not
		considered to connect.</p>
	<p>
		A path is made up of one or more disconnected <i>subpaths</i>, each
		comprising a sequence of connected segments. The topology of the path
		is unrestricted: it may be concave or convex, may contain multiple
		subpaths representing disjoint areas, and may intersect itself in
		arbitrary ways. There is an operator, <a
			href="../8/2/c/closepath.html">closepath</a>, that explicitly
		connects the end of a subpath back to its starting point; such a
		subpath is said to be <i>closed</i>. A subpath that has not been
		explicitly closed is <i>open</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Paths are represented by data structures internal to the PostScript
		interpreter. Although a path is not directly accessible as an object,
		its construction and use are under program control. A path is
		constructed by sequential application of one or more <i>path
			construction operators</i>. PostScript programs can read out the path or,
		more commonly, use it to control the application of one of the
		painting operators described in Section <a href="5.html">4.5,
			"Painting."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Because the entire set of points defining a path
			must exist as data simultaneously, there is a limit to the number of
			segments it may have. Because several paths may also exist
			simultaneously (the current path and the clipping path, both
			discussed below, as well as any paths saved by the <a
			href="../8/2/s/save.html">save</a>, <a href="../8/2/g/gsave.html">gsave</a>,
			<a href="../8/2/c/clipsave.html">clipsave</a>, <a
			href="../8/2/g/gstate.html">gstate</a>, and <a
			href="../8/2/c/currentgstate.html">currentgstate</a> operators), this
			limit applies to the total amount of storage occupied by all paths.
			If a path exhausts the available storage, a <a
			href="../8/2/l/limitcheck.html">limitcheck</a> error occurs.
			LanguageLevel 1 has a fixed limit for path storage that is
			implementation-dependent; see Appendix <a>B</a> for more information.
			In LanguageLevels 2 and 3, there is no such fixed limit; path storage
			competes with other uses of memory.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>As a practical matter, the limits on path storage are large
			enough not to impose an unreasonable restriction. It is important,
			however, that each distinct element of a page be constructed as a
			separate path, painted, and then discarded before constructing the
			next element. Attempting to describe an entire page as a single path
			is likely to exceed the path storage limit.</i>
