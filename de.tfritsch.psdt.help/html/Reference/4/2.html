	<h3>4.2 Graphics State</h3>
	<p>
		The PostScript interpreter maintains an internal data structure called
		the <i>graphics state</i> that holds current graphics control
		parameters. These parameters define the global framework within which
		the graphics operators execute. For example, the <a
			href="../8/2/s/stroke.html">stroke</a> operator implicitly uses the <i>current
			line width</i> parameter from the graphics state, and the <a
			href="../8/2/f/fill.html">fill</a> operator implicitly uses the <i>current
			color</i> parameter.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most graphics state parameters are ordinary PostScript objects that
		can be read and altered by the appropriate graphics state operators.
		For example, the operator <a href="../8/2/s/setlinewidth.html">setlinewidth</a>
		changes the current line width parameter, and <a
			href="../8/2/c/currentlinewidth.html">currentlinewidth</a> reads that
		parameter from the graphics state. In general, the operators that set
		graphics state parameters simply store them unchanged for later use by
		other graphics operators. However, certain parameters have special
		properties or behavior:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Most parameters must be of the correct type or have values
			that fall into a certain range.</li>
		<li>Parameters that are numeric values, such as color, line
			width, and miter limit, are forced into legal range, if necessary,
			and stored as real numbers. If they are later read out, they are
			always real, regardless of how they were originally specified.
			However, they are not adjusted to reflect capabilities of the raster
			output device, such as resolution or number of distinguishable
			colors. Graphics rendering operators perform such adjustments, but
			the adjusted values are not stored back into the graphics state.</li>
		<li>Certain parameters are composite objects, such as arrays or
			dictionaries. Graphics operators consult the values of these objects
			at unpredictable times and may cache them for later use, so altering
			them can have unpredictable results. A PostScript program should
			treat the values of graphics state parameters (including those in
			saved graphics states) as if they were read-only.</li>
		<li>The current path, clipping path, and device parameters are
			internal objects that are not directly accessible to a PostScript
			program.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Table 4.1 lists those graphics state parameters that are
		device-independent and are appropriate to specify in page
		descriptions. The parameters listed in Table 4.2 control details of
		the rendering (scan conversion) process and are device-dependent. A
		page description that is intended to be device-independent should not
		alter these parameters.</p>

	<p>Although it contains many objects, the graphics state is not
		itself a PostScript object and cannot be accessed directly from within
		a PostScript program. However, there are two mechanisms for saving and
		later restoring the entire graphics state. One is the graphics state
		stack, managed by the following operators:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../8/2/g/gsave.html">gsave</a> pushes a copy of the
			entire graphics state onto the stack.</li>
		<li><a href="../8/2/g/grestore.html">grestore</a> restores the
			entire graphics state to its former value by popping it from the
			stack.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The graphics state stack, with its LIFO (last in, first out)
		organization, serves the needs of PostScript programs that are page
		descriptions. A well-structured document typically contains many
		graphical elements that are essentially independent of each other and
		sometimes nested to multiple levels. The <a href="../8/2/g/gsave.html">gsave</a>
		and <a href="../8/2/g/grestore.html">grestore</a> operators can be
		used to encapsulate these elements so that they can make local changes
		to the graphics state without disturbing the graphics state of the
		surrounding environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		In some interactive applications, however, a program must switch its
		attention among multiple, more-or-less independent imaging contexts in
		an unpredictable order. The second mechanism, available in
		LanguageLevels 2 and 3, uses <i>gstate objects</i> in virtual memory
		that contain saved copies of the graphics state. The following
		LanguageLevel 2 operators manipulate gstate objects:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../8/2/g/gstate.html">gstate</a> creates a new
			gstate object.</li>
		<li><a href="../8/2/c/currentgstate.html">currentgstate</a>
			copies the entire current graphics state into a gstate object.</li>
		<li><a href="../8/2/s/setgstate.html">setgstate</a> replaces the
			entire current graphics state by the value of a gstate object.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Interactive programs can use these operators to create a
		separate gstate object for each imaging context and switch among them
		dynamically as needed.</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Saving a graphics state, with either <a
			href="../8/2/g/gsave.html">gsave</a> or <a
			href="../8/2/c/currentgstate.html">currentgstate</a>, captures every
			parameter, including such things as the current path and current
			clipping path. For example, if a nonempty current path exists at the
			time that <a href="../8/2/g/gsave.html">gsave</a>, <a
			href="../8/2/g/gstate.html">gstate</a>, or <a
			href="../8/2/c/currentgstate.html">currentgstate</a> is executed,
			that path will be reinstated by the corresponding <a
			href="../8/2/g/grestore.html">grestore</a> or <a
			href="../8/2/s/setgstate.html">setgstate</a>. Unless this effect is
			specifically desired, it is best to minimize storage demands by
			saving a graphics state only when the current path is empty and the
			current clipping path is in its default state.</i>
