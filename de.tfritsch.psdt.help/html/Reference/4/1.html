	<h3>4.1 Imaging Model</h3>
	<p>The Adobe imaging model is a simple and unified view of
		two-dimensional graphics borrowed from the graphic arts. A PostScript
		program builds an image by placing "paint" on a "page" in selected
		areas.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The painted figures may be in the form of letter shapes,
			general filled shapes, lines, or digitally sampled representations of
			photographs.</li>
		<li>The paint may be in color or in black, white, or any shade of
			gray.</li>
		<li>The paint may take the form of a repeating pattern <i>(LanguageLevel
				2)</i> or a smooth transition between colors <i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i>.
		</li>
		<li>Any of these elements may be clipped to appear within other
			shapes as they are placed onto the page.</li>
		<li>Once a page has been built up to the desired form, it may be
			transmitted to an output device.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The PostScript interpreter maintains an implicit <i>current page</i>
		that accumulates the marks made by the <i>painting operators</i>. When
		a program begins, the current page is completely blank. As each
		painting operator executes, it places marks on the current page. Each
		new mark completely obscures any marks it may overlay (subject to the
		effects of the overprint parameter in the graphics state; see Section
		<a href="8/5.html">4.8.5</a>). This method is known as a <i>painting
			model</i>: no matter what color a mark has&mdash;white, black, gray, or
		color&mdash;it is put onto the current page as if it were applied with
		opaque paint. Once the page has been completely composed, invoking the
		<a href="../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a> operator renders the
		accumulated marks on the output media and then clears the current page
		to white again.
	</p>
	<p>The principal painting operators (among many others) are as
		follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../8/2/f/fill.html">fill</a> paints an area.</li>
		<li><a href="../8/2/s/stroke.html">stroke</a> paints lines.</li>
		<li><a href="../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> paints a sampled
			image.</li>
		<li><a href="../8/2/s/show.html">show</a> paints glyphs
			representing character shapes.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The painting operators require various parameters, some explicit and
		others implicit. Chief among the implicit parameters is the <i>current
			path</i> used by <a href="../8/2/f/fill.html">fill</a>, <a
			href="../8/2/s/stroke.html">stroke</a>, and <a
			href="../8/2/s/show.html">show</a>. A path consists of a sequence of
		connected and disconnected points, lines, and curves that together
		describe shapes and their positions. It is built up through the
		sequential application of the <i>path construction operators</i>, each
		of which modifies the current path in some way, usually by appending
		one new element.
	</p>
	<p>
		Path construction operators include <a href="../8/2/n/newpath.html">newpath</a>,
		<a href="../8/2/m/moveto.html">moveto</a>, <a
			href="../8/2/l/lineto.html">lineto</a>, <a
			href="../8/2/c/curveto.html">curveto</a>, <a>arc</a>, and <a
			href="../8/2/c/closepath.html">closepath</a>. None of the path
		construction operators places marks on the current page; the painting
		operators do that. Path construction operators create the shapes that
		the painting operators paint. Some operators, such as <a
			href="../8/2/u/ufill.html">ufill</a> and <a
			href="../8/2/u/ustroke.html">ustroke</a>, combine path construction
		and painting in a single operation for efficiency.
	</p>
	<p>Implicit parameters to the painting operators include the
		current color, current line width, current font (typeface and size),
		and many others. There are operators that examine and set each
		implicit parameter in the graphics state. The values used for implicit
		parameters are those in effect at the time an operator is invoked.</p>
	<p>PostScript programs contain many instances of the following
		typical sequence of steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Build a path using path construction operators.</li>
		<li>Set any implicit parameters if their values need to change.</li>
		<li>Perform a painting operation.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		There is one additional implicit element in the Adobe imaging model
		that modifies this description: the <i>current clipping path</i>
		outlines the area of the current page on which paint may be placed.
		Initially, this path outlines the entire imageable area of the current
		page. By using the <a href="../8/2/c/clip.html">clip</a> operator, a
		PostScript program can shrink the path to any shape desired. Although
		painting operators may attempt to place marks anywhere on the current
		page, only those marks falling within the current clipping path will
		affect the page; those falling outside it will not.
