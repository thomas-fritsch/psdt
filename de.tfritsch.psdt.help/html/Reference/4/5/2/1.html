	<h4>Nonzero Winding Number Rule</h4>
	<p>
		The <i>nonzero winding number</i> rule determines whether a given
		point is inside a path by conceptually drawing a ray from that point
		to infinity in any direction and then examining the places where a
		segment of the path crosses the ray. Starting with a count of 0, the
		rule adds 1 each time a path segment crosses the ray from left to
		right and subtracts 1 each time a segment crosses from right to left.
		After counting all the crossings, if the result is 0 then the point is
		outside the path; otherwise it is inside.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The method just described does not specify what to
			do if a path segment coincides with or is tangent to the chosen ray.
			Since the direction of the ray is arbitrary, the rule simply chooses
			a ray that does not encounter such problem intersections.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		For simple convex paths, the nonzero winding number rule defines the
		inside and outside as one would intuitively expect. The more
		interesting cases are those involving complex or self-intersecting
		paths like the ones in Figure 4.3. For a path consisting of a
		five-pointed star, drawn with five connected straight line segments
		intersecting each other, the rule considers the inside to be the
		entire area enclosed by the star, including the pentagon in the
		center. For a path composed of two concentric circles, the areas
		enclosed by both circles are considered to be inside, <i>provided
			that both are drawn in the same direction</i>. If the circles are drawn
		in opposite directions, only the "doughnut" shape between them is
		inside, according to the rule; the "doughnut hole" is outside.
