	<h4>Even-Odd Rule</h4>
	<p>
		An alternative to the nonzero winding number rule is the <i>even-odd
			rule</i>. This rule determines the "insideness" of a point by drawing a
		ray from that point in any direction and simply counting the number of
		path segments that cross the ray, regardless of direction. If this
		number is odd, the point is inside; if even, the point is outside.
		This yields the same results as the nonzero winding number rule for
		paths with simple shapes, but produces different results for more
		complex shapes.
	</p>
	<p>Figure 4.4 shows the effects of applying the even-odd rule to
		complex paths. For the five-pointed star, the rule considers the
		triangular points to be inside the path, but not the pentagon in the
		center. For the two concentric circles, only the "doughnut" shape
		between the two circles is considered inside, regardless of the
		directions in which the circles are drawn.</p>
