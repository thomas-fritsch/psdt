	<h3>4.5.3 Insideness Testing</h3>
	<p>It is sometimes useful for a program to test whether a point
		lies inside a path, or whether a path intersects another path, without
		actually painting anything. The LanguageLevel 2 insideness-testing
		operators can be used for this purpose. They are useful mainly for
		interactive applications, where they can assist in hit detection;
		however, they have other uses as well.</p>
	<p>
		There are several insideness-testing operators that vary according to
		how the paths to be tested are specified. All of the operators return
		a single boolean result. What it means for a point to be inside a path
		is that painting the path (by <a href="../../8/2/f/fill.html">fill</a>
		or <a href="../../8/2/s/stroke.html">stroke</a>) would cause the
		device pixel lying under that point to be marked. The insideness tests
		disregard the current clipping path.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/i/infill.html">infill</a> tests the
			current path in the graphics state. There are two forms of this
			operator. One returns true if painting the current path with the fill
			operator would result in marking the device pixel corresponding to a
			specific point in user space. The second tests whether any pixels
			within a specified aperture would be marked. The aperture is
			specified by a user path supplied as an operand (see Section <a
			href="../6.html">4.6, "User Paths"</a>).</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/i/instroke.html">instroke</a> is similar
			to <a href="../../8/2/i/infill.html">infill</a>, but it tests pixels
			that would be marked by applying the stroke operator to the current
			path, using the current settings of the stroke-related parameters in
			the graphics state (line width, dash pattern, and so forth).</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/i/inufill.html">inufill</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/i/inustroke.html">inustroke</a> are similar to <a
			href="../../8/2/i/infill.html">infill</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/i/instroke.html">instroke</a>, but they test a user
			path supplied as a separate operand, rather than the current path in
			the graphics state.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/i/ineofill.html">ineofill</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/i/inueofill.html">inueofill</a> are similar to <a
			href="../../8/2/i/infill.html">infill</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/i/inufill.html">inufill</a>, but they use the
			even-odd rule instead of the nonzero winding number rule for
			insideness testing; see Section <a href="2.html">4.5.2,
				"Filling,"</a> for more information.</li>
