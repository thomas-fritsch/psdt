	<h3>4.5.2 Filling</h3>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/f/fill.html">fill</a> operator uses the current
		color or pattern to paint the entire region enclosed by the current
		path. If the path consists of several disconnected subpaths, fill
		paints the insides of all subpaths, considered together. Any subpaths
		that are open are implicitly closed before being filled.
	</p>
	<p>For a simple path, it is intuitively clear what region lies
		inside. However, for a more complex path&mdash;for example, a path
		that intersects itself or has one subpath that encloses
		another&mdash;the interpretation of "inside" is not always obvious.
		The path machinery uses one of two rules for determining which points
		lie inside a path: the nonzero winding number rule and the even-odd
		rule, both discussed in detail below.</p>
	<p>
		The nonzero winding number rule is more versatile than the even-odd
		rule and is the standard rule the <a href="../../8/2/f/fill.html">fill</a>
		operator uses. Similarly, the <a href="../../8/2/c/clip.html">clip</a>
		operator uses this rule to determine the inside of the current
		clipping path. The even-odd rule is occasionally useful for special
		effects or for compatibility with other graphics systems. The <a
			href="../../8/2/e/eofill.html">eofill</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/e/eoclip.html">eoclip</a> operators invoke this rule.
