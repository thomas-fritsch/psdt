	<h3>4.10 Images</h3>
	<p>
		The PostScript language's painting operators include general
		facilities for dealing with sampled images. A <i>sampled image</i> (or
		just "image" for short) is a rectangular array of <i>sample values</i>,
		each representing a color. The image may approximate the appearance of
		some natural scene obtained through an input scanner or a video
		camera, or it may be generated synthetically.
	</p>

	<p>
		An image is defined by a sequence of samples obtained by scanning the
		image array in row or column order. Each sample in the array consists
		of as many color components as are needed for the color space in which
		they are specified&mdash;for example, one component for <b>DeviceGray</b>,
		three for <b>DeviceRGB</b>, four for DeviceCMYK, or whatever number is
		required by a particular <b>DeviceN</b> space. Each component consists
		of a 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, or 12-bit integer, permitting the representation
		of 2, 4, 16, 256, or 4096 different values for each component.
	</p>
	<p>Depending on LanguageLevel, PostScript implementations differ in
		the facilities they offer for images:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Most LanguageLevel 1 implementations support only grayscale
			images&mdash;that is, ones whose image samples consist of a single
			gray component. These can be painted by means of the five-operand
			form of the <a href="../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator. Image
			samples must consist of 1, 2, 4, or 8 bits per component; 12-bit
			components are not supported. The image's source data must be
			provided by a procedure and not directly by a file or string.
		</li>
		<li>A few LanguageLevel 1 implementations have been extended to
			support color images containing three or four components per sample,
			interpreted as RGB or CMYK. These can be painted by means of the <a
			href="../8/2/c/colorimage.html">colorimage</a> operator.
			LanguageLevel 1 products containing this feature are primarily color
			printers, and also support the <a href="../8/2/s/setcmykcolor.html">setcmykcolor</a>
			operator and 4-color rendering features.
		</li>
		<li>LanguageLevel 2 includes all features of LanguageLevel 1.
			Additionally, it supports a one-operand form of the <a
			href="../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator in which the operand is
			an <i>image dictionary</i>, providing a more general means for
			specifying the image's characteristics. Other LanguageLevel 2
			features include 12-bit component values, direct use of files or
			strings as data sources, interpretation of sample values in arbitrary
			color spaces (such as CIE-based), and additional decoding and
			rendering options.
		</li>
		<li>All implementations support the <a
			href="../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> operator, which paints
			the current color through a stencil mask specified as a bitmap (see <a
			href="10/6/1.html">"Stencil Masking" on page 302</a>). However,
			specification of the operands using an image dictionary is a
			LanguageLevel 2 feature.
		</li>
		<li>LanguageLevel 3 supports two additional forms of masking,
			using explicit masks and color key masks. These features are
			described in the sections <a href="10/6/2.html">"Explicit
				Masking" on page 303</a> and <a href="10/6/3.html">"Color Key
				Masking" on page 307</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are often several ways to paint a given image, depending
		on the level of language features to be used. Fortunately, most
		properties of images do not depend on how painting is invoked or how
		operands are represented. The sections that follow frequently refer to
		specific features, such as colorimage or image dictionaries; see the
		summary above to determine which features are available in a
		particular PostScript implementation.</p>
