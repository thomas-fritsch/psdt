	<h3>4.4.1 Current Path</h3>
	<p>
		The <i>current path</i> is part of the graphics state. The path
		construction operators <i>modify</i> the current path, usually by
		appending to it, and the painting operators implicitly <i>refer</i> to
		the current path. The <a href="../../8/2/g/gsave.html">gsave</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/g/grestore.html">grestore</a> operators respectively
		save and restore the current path, as they do all components of the
		graphics state.
	</p>
	<p>
		A program begins a new path by invoking the <a
			href="../../8/2/n/newpath.html">newpath</a> operator. This
		initializes the current path to be empty. (Some of the painting
		operators also reinitialize the current path at the end of their
		execution.) The program then builds up the definition of the path by
		applying one or more of the operators that add segments to the current
		path. These operators may be invoked in any sequence, but the first
		one invoked must be <a href="../../8/2/m/moveto.html">moveto</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The trailing endpoint of the segment most recently added is referred
		to as the current point. If the current path is empty, the current
		point is undefined. Most operators that add a segment to the current
		path start at the current point. If the current point is undefined,
		they generate the error <a href="../../8/2/n/nocurrentpoint.html">nocurrentpoint</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Following is a list of the most common path construction
		operators. There are other, less common ones as well; see Chapter 8
		for complete details.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/m/moveto.html">moveto</a> establishes a
			new current point without adding a segment to the current path,
			thereby beginning a new subpath.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/l/lineto.html">lineto</a> adds a straight
			line segment to the current path, connecting the previous current
			point to the new one.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/a/arc.html">arc</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/a/arcn.html">arcn</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/a/arct.html">arct</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/a/arcto.html">arcto</a> add an arc of a circle to the
			current path.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/curveto.html">curveto</a> adds a section
			of a cubic B&eacute;zier curve to the current path.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/r/rmoveto.html">rmoveto</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/rlineto.html">rlineto</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/r/rcurveto.html">rcurveto</a> perform the <a
			href="../../8/2/m/moveto.html">moveto</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/l/lineto.html">lineto</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/c/curveto.html">curveto</a> operations, but specify
			new points via displacements in user space relative to the current
			point, rather than by absolute coordinates.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/closepath.html">closepath</a> adds a
			straight line segment connecting the current point to the starting
			point of the current subpath (usually the point most recently
			specified by <a href="../../8/2/m/moveto.html">moveto</a>), thereby
			closing the current subpath.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Remember that the path construction operators do
			not place any marks on the page; only the painting operators do that.
			The usual procedure for painting a graphical element on the page is
			to define that element as a path and then invoke one of the painting
			operators. This is repeated for each element on the page.</i>
	</p>
	<p>All of the points used to describe the path are specified in
		user space. All coordinates are transformed by the CTM into device
		space at the time the program adds the point to the current path.
		Changing the CTM does not affect the coordinates of existing points in
		device space.</p>
	<p>A path that is to be used more than once in a page description
		can be defined by a PostScript procedure that invokes the operators
		for constructing the path. Each instance of the path can then be
		constructed and painted on the page by a threestep sequence:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Modify the CTM, if necessary, by invoking coordinate
			transformation operators to locate, orient, and scale the path to the
			desired place on the page.</li>
		<li>Call the procedure to construct the path.</li>
		<li>Invoke a painting operator to mark the path on the page in
			the desired manner.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		In the common situation that the path description is constant, the
		LanguageLevel 2 user path operators (described in Section <a
			href="../6.html">4.6, "User Paths"</a>) can be used to combine steps
		2 and 3. The entire sequence can be encapsulated by surrounding it
		with the operators <a href="../../8/2/g/gsave.html">gsave</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/g/grestore.html">grestore</a>. See Example 4.1 on
		page 185 for a simple illustration of this technique.
