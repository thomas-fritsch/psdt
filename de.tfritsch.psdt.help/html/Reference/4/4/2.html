	<h3>4.4.2 Clipping Path</h3>
	<p>
		The graphics state also contains a <i>clipping path</i> that limits
		the regions of the page affected by the painting operators. The closed
		subpaths of this path define the area that can be painted. Marks
		falling inside this area will be applied to the page; those falling
		outside it will not. (Precisely what is considered to be "inside" a
		path is discussed in Section <a href="../5/2.html">4.5.2,
			"Filling."</a>) The clipping path affects current painting operations
		only; it has no effect on paths being constructed with the path
		construction operators listed in Section <a href="1.html">4.4.1</a>.
		When such a path is eventually painted, the results will be limited
		only by the clipping path current at that time, and not by the one in
		effect when the path was constructed.
	</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 3, the graphics state can also contain a subsidiary
		stack of saved clipping paths, which are pushed and popped by the <a
			href="../../8/2/c/clipsave.html">clipsave</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/c/.html">cliprestore</a> operators. This enables a
		program to save and restore just the clipping path without affecting
		the rest of the graphics state. Because the clipping path stack is an
		element of the graphics state, wholesale replacement of the graphics
		state by <a href="../../8/2/g/grestore.html">grestore</a> or <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setgstate.html">setgstate</a> will replace the
		entire clipping path stack.
	</p>
	<p>The following operators manage the clipping path:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/clip.html">clip</a> computes a new
			clipping path from the intersection of the current path with the
			existing clipping path.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/clippath.html">clippath</a> replaces the
			current path with a copy of the current clipping path.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/clipsave.html">clipsave</a> <i>(LanguageLevel
				3)</i> pushes a copy of the current clipping path onto the clipping path
			stack.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/cliprestore.html">cliprestore</a> <i>(LanguageLevel
				3)</i> pops the topmost element off the clipping path stack and makes it
			the current clipping path.</li>
	</ul>
