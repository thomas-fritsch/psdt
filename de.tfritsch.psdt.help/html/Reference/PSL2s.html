<B>save</B> - save <BR>
<BR>
save creates a snapshot of the current state of the virtual memory (VM)
and returns a save object representing that snapshot. Subsequently, this
save object may be presented to restore to reset the VM to this snapshot.
See the restore operator for a detailed description of what is saved in
the snapshot. save also saves the current graphics state by pushing a copy
of it on the graphics state stack in a manner similar to <A HREF="PSL2gh.html#gsave">gsave</A>.
This saved graphics state is restored by <A HREF="PSL2qr.html#restore">restore</A>
and <A HREF="PSL2gh.html#grestoreall">grestoreall</A>. <BR>

<B>scale</B> sx sy scale sx sy matrix scale matrix <BR>
<BR>
With no matrix operand, scale builds a temporary matrix and concatenates
this matrix with the current transformation matrix (CTM). Precisely, scale
replaces the CTM by S x CTM. The effect of this is to make the x and y units
in the user coordinate system the size of sx and sy units in the former
user coordinate system. The position of the user coordinate origin and the
orientation of the axes are unchanged. If the matrix operand is supplied,
scale replaces the value of matrix by S and pushes the modified matrix back
on the operand stack In this case, scale does not affect the CTM.<BR>

<HR><A NAME="scalefont"></A><BR>
<B>scalefont</B> font scale scalefont font' <BR>
<BR>
applies the scale factor scale to font, producing a new font' whose characters
are scaled by scale (in both x and y) when they are shown. scalefont first
creates a copy of font, then replaces the new font's FontMatrix entry with
the result of scaling the existing FontMatrix by scale. <BR>
It inserts two additional entries, OrigFont and ScaleMatrix, whose purpose
is internal to the implementation. Finally, it returns the result as font'.
Showing characters from the transformed font produces the same results as
showing from the original font after having scaled user space by the factor
scale in both x and y by means of the <A HREF="#scale">scale</A> operator.
<BR>
scalefont is essentially a convenience operator that enables the desired
scale factor to be encapsulated in the font description. Another operator,
makefont, performs more general transformations than simple scaling. See
the description of makefont for more information on how the transformed
font is derived. selectfont combines the effects of findfont and scalefont.
The interpreter keeps track of font dictionaries recently created by scalefont.
<BR>
Calling scalefont multiple times with the same font and scale will usually
return the same font' rather than create a new one each time. However, it
is usually more efficient for a PostScript language program to apply scalefont
only once for each font that it needs and to keep track of the resulting
font dictionaries on its own.&quot; <BR>
The <A HREF="PSL2m.html#makefont">makefont</A>, scalefont, and <A HREF="#selectfont">selectfont</A>
operators produce a font dictionary derived from an original font dictionary,
but with the FontMatrix entry altered. The derived font dictionary is allocated
in local or global VM according to whether the original font dictionary
is in local or global VM. This is independent of the current VM allocation
mode. <BR>
<BR>
EXAMPLE:<BR>
<BR>
/Helvetica findfont 12 scalefont setfont <BR>
<BR>
This obtains the standard Helvetica font, which is defined with a 1-unit
line height, and scales it by a factor of 12 in both x and y dimensions.
This produces a 12-unit high font (i.e., a 12-point font in default user
space) whose characters have the same proportions as those in the original
font. <BR>

<B>search</B> string seek search post match pre true (if found)<BR>
string false (if not found) <BR>
<BR>
looks for the first occurrence of the string seek within string and returns
results of this search on the operand stack. The topmost result is a boolean
that indicates if the search succeeded. If search finds a subsequence of
string whose elements are equal to the elements of seek, it splits string
into three segments: pre, the portion of string preceding the match; match,
the portion of string that matches seek; and post, the remainder of string.
It then pushes the string objects post, match, and pre on the operand stack,
followed by the boolean true. All three of these strings are substrings
sharing intervals of the value of the original string. If search does not
find a match, it pushes the original string and the boolean false. <BR>

<HR><A NAME="selectfont"></A><BR>
<B>selectfont</B> key scale selectfont - key matrix selectfont - LEVEL 2
<BR>
<BR>
obtains a font whose name is key, transforms it according to scale or matrix,
and establishes it as the current font dictionary in the graphics state.
<BR>
selectfont is equivalent to one of the following, according to whether the
second operand is a number or a matrix: <BR>
key <A HREF="PSL2f.html#findfont">findfont</A> <A HREF="#scale">scale</A>
<A HREF="#scalefont">scalefont</A> <A HREF="#setfont">setfont</A> key <A HREF="PSL2f.html#findfont">findfont</A>

<A HREF="#setfont">setfont</A> <BR>
<BR>
If the font named by key is already defined in VM, selectfont obtains the
font dictionary directly and does not execute findfont. However, if the
font is not defined, selectfont invokes findfont in the normal way. In the
latter case, it actually executes the name object <A HREF="PSL2f.html#findfont">findfont</A>,
so it uses the current definition of that name in the environment of the
dictionary stack. <BR>
On the other hand, redefining <A HREF="PSL2e.html#exch">exch</A>, <A HREF="#scalefont">scalefont</A>,
<A HREF="PSL2m.html#makefont">makefont</A>, or <A HREF="#setfont">setfont</A>
would not alter the behavior of selectfont. selectfont can give rise to
any of the errors possible for the component operations, including arbitrary
errors from a user-defined <A HREF="PSL2f.html#findfont">findfont</A> procedure.
<BR>
<BR>
EXAMPLE: <BR>
/Helvetica 10 selectfont /Helvetica findfont 10 scalefont setfont <BR>
<BR>
The two lines of the example have the same effect, but the first one is
almost always more efficient. The makefont, scalefont, and selectfont operators
produce a font dictionary derived from an original font dictionary, but
with the FontMatrix entry altered. <BR>
The derived font dictionary is allocated in local or global VM according
to whether the original font dictionary is in local or global VM. This is
independent of the current VM allocation mode. <BR>

<HR><A NAME="setbbox"></A><BR>
<B>setbbox</B> llx lly urx ury setbbox <BR>
<BR>
- establishes a bounding box for the current path, within which the coordinates
of all subsequent path construction operators must fall. <BR>
The bounding box is defined by two pairs of coordinates in user space: <BR>
llx and lly specify the lower-left corner, <BR>
urx and ury the upper-right corner. <BR>
It is a rectangle oriented with the user space coordinate system axes. The
bounding box remains in effect for the lifetime of the current path-that
is, until the next newpath or operator that resets the path implicitly.
Any attempt to append a path element with a coordinate lying outside the
bounding box will give rise to a rangecheck error. <BR>
Note that arcs are converted to sequences of curveto operations. The coordinates
computed as control points for those curvetos must also fall within the
bounding box. This means that the figure of the arc must be entirely enclosed
by the bounding box. On the other hand, the bounds checking applies only
to the path itself, not to the result of rendering the path. <BR>
For example, stroking the path may place marks outside the bounding box.
This does not cause an error. Although the setbbox operator can be used
when defining any path, its main use is in defining a user path, where it
is mandatory. That is, a user path procedure passed to one of the user path
rendering operators, such as <A HREF="PSL2u.html#ufill">ufill</A>, must
begin with a setbbox optionally preceded by a <A HREF="PSL2u.html#ucache">ucache</A>.<BR>
The bounding box information passed to setbbox enables the user path rendering
operator to optimize execution. <BR>
If setbbox appears more than once during definition of a path, the path's
effective bounding box is successively enlarged to enclose the union of
all specified bounding boxes. This is not legal in a user path definition.
However, this case might arise if uappend is executed multiple times in
building up a single current path by concatenating several user paths. <BR>
If setbbox has established a bounding box, execution of pathbbox returns
a result derived from that bounding box instead of one derived from the
actual path. The upper-right coordinate values must be greater than or equal
to the lower-left values. Otherwise, a <A HREF="PSL2qr.html#rangecheck">rangecheck</A>
error will occur. <BR>

sets the black generation function parameter in the graphics state. The
proc operand must be a procedure that can be called with a number in the
range 0.0 to 1.0 (inclusive) on the operand stack and that returns a number
in the same range. This procedure computes the value of the black component
during conversion from DeviceRGB color space to DeviceCMYK. <BR>

dependent. It should not be used in a page description that is intended
to be device independent.<BR>

<B>setcachedevice</B> wx wy llx lly urx ury setcachedevice <BR>
<BR>
- passes width and bounding box information to the PostScript interpreter's
font machinery. setcachedevice may be executed only within the context of
the BuildGlyph or BuildChar procedure for a type 3 font. <BR>
BuildGlyph or BuildChar must invoke setcachedevice, <A HREF="#setcachedevice2">setcachedevice2</A>,
or <A HREF="#setcharwidth">setcharwidth</A> before executing graphics operators
to define and paint the character. setcachedevice requests the font machinery
to transfer the results of those operators both into the font cache, if
possible, and onto the current page. The operands to setcachedevice are
all numbers interpreted in the character coordinate system . <BR>
wx and wy comprise the basic width vector for this character-in other words,
the normal position of the origin of the next character relative to origin
of this one. llx and lly are the coordinates of the lower-left corner and
urx and ury are the coordinates of the upper-right corner of the character
bounding box. The character bounding box is the smallest rectangle, oriented
with the character coordinate system axes, that completely encloses all
marks placed on the page as a result of executing the character's description.
<BR>
For a character defined as a path, this may be determined by means of the
pathbbox operator. The font machinery needs this information to make decisions
about clipping and caching. The declared bounding box must be correct-in
other words, sufficiently large to enclose the entire character. If any
marks fall outside this bounding box, they will be clipped off and not moved
to the current page. setcachedevice installs identical sets of metrics for
writing modes 0 and 1, while <A HREF="#setcachedevice2">setcachedevice2</A>
installs separate metrics. <BR>
After execution of setcachedevice and until the termination of the BuildGlyph
or BuildChar procedure, execution of color setting operators or image is
not allowed. Note that use of the <A HREF="PSL2ik.html#imagemask">imagemask</A>
operator is permitted. <BR>

<HR><A NAME="setcachelimit"></A><BR>
<B>setcachelimit</B> int setcachelimit <BR>
<BR>
- establishes the maximum number of bytes the pixel array of a single cached
character may occupy. Any character larger than this (according to the character
bounding box information passed to setcachedevice) is not saved in the font
cache. Instead, its description is executed every time the character is
encountered. setcachelimit affects the decision whether to place new characters
in the font cache; it does not disturb any characters already in the cache.
<BR>
Making the limit larger allows larger characters to be cached, but may decrease
the total number of different characters that can be held in the cache simultaneously.
Changing this parameter is appropriate only in very unusual situations.
<BR>
The maximum limit for int is implementation dependent, representing the
total available size of the font cache (see cachestatus). As a practical
matter, int should not be larger than a small fraction of the total font
cache size. Modifications to the cache limit parameter obey save and restore.
<BR>
In a Display PostScript system, which supports multiple contexts, this parameter
is maintained separately for each context. The parameter set by setcachelimit
is the same as the MaxFontItem user parameter set by <A HREF="#setuserparams">setuserparams</A>.

<B>setcacheparams</B> mark size lower upper setcacheparams - LEVEL 2 <BR>
<BR>
sets cache parameters as specified by the integer objects above the topmost
mark on the stack, then removes all operands and the mark object as if by
cleartomark. The number of cache parameters is variable. <BR>
In future versions of the PostScript interpreter, there may be more than
three cache parameters defined. If more operands are supplied to setcacheparams
than are needed, the topmost ones are used and the remainder ignored. If
fewer are supplied than are needed, setcacheparams implicitly inserts default
values between the mark and the first supplied operand. <BR>
The upper operand specifies the maximum number of bytes the pixel array
of a single cached character may occupy, as determined from the information
presented by the <A HREF="#setcachedevice">setcachedevice</A> operator.
This is the same parameter set by <A HREF="#setcachelimit">setcachelimit</A>.
<BR>
The lower operand specifies the threshold at which characters may be stored
in compressed form rather than as full pixel arrays. If a character's pixel
array requires more than lower bytes to represent, it may be compressed
in the cache and reconstituted from the compressed representation each time
it is needed. Some devices do not support compression of characters. Setting
lower to zero forces all characters to be compressed, permitting more characters
to be stored in the cache, but increasing the work required to print them.
Setting lower to a value greater than or equal to upper disables compression
altogether. <BR>
The size operand specifies the new size of the font cache in bytes (the
bmax value returned by cachestatus). If size is not specified, the font
cache size is unchanged. If size lies outside the range of font cache sizes
permitted by the implementation, the nearest permissible size is substituted
with no error indication. <BR>
Reducing the font cache size can cause some existing cached characters to
be discarded, increasing execution time when those characters are next shown.
The parameters set by setcacheparams are the same as the MaxFontCache system
parameter and the MinFontCompress and MaxFontItem user parameters, set by
<A HREF="#setsystemparams">setsystemparams</A> and <A HREF="#setuserparams">setuserparams</A>,
respectively .<BR>

- is similar to setcachedevice, but it passes only width information to
the PostScript interpreter's font machinery and it declares that the character
being defined is not to be placed in the font cache. setcharwidth is useful,
for example, in defining characters that incorporate two or more specific
opaque colors, such as opaque black and opaque white. <BR>
This is unusual. Most characters have no inherent color, but are painted
with the current color within the character's outline, leaving the area
outside unpainted (transparent). Another use of setcharwidth is in defining
characters that intentionally change their behavior based on the environment
in which they execute. Such characters must not be cached, because that
would subvert the intended variable behavior. <BR>

The second form specifies a color space by giving just its name. This is

<B>setdash</B> array offset setdash <BR>
<BR>
- sets the dash pattern parameter in the graphics state, controlling the
dash pattern used during subsequent executions of the stroke operator and
operators based on stroke, such as rectstroke and ustroke.<BR>
If array is empty (i.e., its length is zero), stroke produces a normal,
unbroken line. <BR>
If array is not empty, stroke produces dashed lines whose pattern is given
by the elements of array, all of which must be non-negative numbers and
not all zero. stroke interprets the elements of array in sequence as distances
along the path, measured in user space. <BR>
These distances alternately specify the length of a dash and the length
of a gap between dashes. stroke uses the contents of array cyclically. When
it reaches the end of the array, it starts again at the beginning. Dashed
lines wrap around curves and corners just as normal strokes do. <BR>
The ends of each dash are treated with the <A HREF="PSL2c.html#currentlinecap">current
line cap</A>; corners within a dash are treated with the <A HREF="PSL2c.html#currentlinejoin">current
line join</A>. stroke does not take any measures to coordinate the dash
pattern with features of the path. It simply dispenses dashes along the
path as specified by array. <BR>
The offset operand may be thought of as the &quot;phase&quot; of the dash
pattern relative to the start of the path. It is interpreted as a distance
into the dash pattern (measured in user space) at which the pattern should
be started. <BR>
Before beginning to stroke a path, stroke cycles through the elements of
array, adding up distances and alternating dashes and gaps as usual, but
without generating any output. When it has travelled the offset distance
into the dash pattern, it starts stroking the path from its beginning, using
the dash pattern from the point that has been reached. Each subpath of a
path is treated independently-in other words, the dash pattern is restarted
and offset applied to it at the beginning of each subpath. <BR>

<B>setdevparams</B> string dict setdevparams - LEVEL 2 <BR>
<BR>
attempts to set one or more parameters for the device identified by string
according to keys and new values contained in the dict operand. The string
identifies a storage or I/O device <BR>
. The dictionary is a container for key-value pairs; setdevparams reads
the information from the dictionary but does not retain the dictionary itself.
Device parameters whose keys are not mentioned in dict are left unchanged.
Each parameter is identified by a key, which is always a name object. The
value is usually (but not necessarily) an integer. The names of I/O devices
and the names and semantics of their parameters are product-dependent. They
are not documented in this manual, but rather in product-specific documentation.
<BR>
Permission to alter device parameters is controlled by a password. The dictionary
must contain an entry named Password whose value is the system parameter
password (a string or integer). If the password is incorrect, setdevparams
executes an <A HREF="PSL2ik.html#invalidaccess">invalidaccess</A> error
and does not alter any parameters. Some device parameters can be set permanently
in non-volatile storage that survives restarts of the PostScript interpreter.
This capability is implementation dependent. <BR>
No error occurs if parameters cannot be stored permanently. Various errors
are possible. Details of error behavior are product dependent, but the following
behavior is typical: 
<UL>
  <LI>If a parameter name is not known to the implementation, an <A HREF="PSL2u.html#undefined">undefined</A>

  <LI>If a parameter value is reasonable but cannot be achieved by the implementation,
either the nearest achievable value is substituted or a <A HREF="PSL2c.html#configurationerror">configurationerror</A>

<B>setflat</B> num setflat <BR>
<BR>
- sets the flatness parameter in the graphics state to num, which must be
a positive number. This controls the accuracy with which curved path segments
are to be rendered on the raster output device by operators such as stroke,
fill, and clip. Those operators render curves by approximating them with
a series of straight line segments. &quot;Flatness&quot; is an informal
term for the error tolerance of this approximation; it is the maximum distance
of any point of the approximation from the corresponding point on the true
curve, measured in output device pixels. <BR>
If the flatness parameter is large enough to cause visible straight line
segments to appear, the result is unpredictable. The purpose of setflat
is to control the accuracy of curve rendering, not to draw inscribed polygons.
<BR>
The choice of flatness value is a trade-off between accuracy and execution
efficiency. Very small values (less than 1 device pixel) produce very accurate
curves at high cost, because enormous numbers of tiny line segments must
be produced. Larger values produce cruder approximations with substantially
less computation. A default value of the flatness parameter is established
by the device setup routine for each raster output device. This value is
based on characteristics of that device and is the one suitable for most
applications. <BR>
The acceptable range of values for num is 0.2 to 100. Values outside this
range are forced into range without error indication. setflat sets a graphics
state parameter whose effect is device dependent. It should not be used
in a page description that is intended to be device independent. <BR>

- sets the line width parameter in the graphics state to num. This controls
the thickness of lines rendered by subsequent execution of the stroke operator.
stroke paints all points whose perpendicular distance from the current path
in user space is less than or equal to one-half the absolute value of num.
The effect produced in device space depends on the current transformation
matrix (CTM) in effect at the time of the stroke. <BR>
If the CTM specifies scaling by different factors in the x and y dimensions,
the thickness of stroked lines in device space will vary according to their
orientation. A line width of zero is acceptable: It is interpreted as the
thinnest line that can be rendered at device resolution-in other words,
one device pixel wide. Some devices cannot reproduce one-pixel lines, and
on high-resolution devices, such lines are nearly invisible. <BR>
Since the results of rendering such &quot;zero-width&quot; lines are device
dependent, their use is not recommended. The actual line width achieved
by stroke can differ from the requested width by as much as two device pixels,
depending on the positions of lines with respect to the pixel grid. One

operator's treatment of corners when miter joins have been specified (see
<A HREF="#setlinejoin">setlinejoin</A>). <BR>
When path segments connect at a sharp angle, a miter join results in a spike
that extends well beyond the connection point. The purpose of the miter
limit is to cut off such spikes when they become objectionably long. At

miter. <BR>

the ratio of the miter length to the line width exceeds the miter limit
parameter, stroke treats the corner with a bevel join instead of a miter
join. The ratio of miter length to line width is directly related to the
angle j between the segments in user space by the formula: <BR>
Examples of miter limit values are: 1.415 cuts off miters (converts them
to bevels) at angles less than 90 degrees, 2.0 cuts off miters at angles
less than 60 degrees, and 10.0 cuts off miters at angles less than 11 degrees.
The default value of the miter limit is 10. Setting the miter limit to 1
cuts off miters at all angles so that bevels are always produced even when
miters are specified. <BR>

<BR>
establishes the number representation to be used in binary object sequences
written by subsequent execution of printobject and writeobject. Output produced
by those operators will have a token type that identifies the representation
used. <BR>
The int operand is one of the following : 
<UL>
  <LI>Disable binary encodings (see below). 
  <LI>High-order byte first, IEEE standard real format. 
  <LI>Low-order byte first, IEEE standard real format. 
  <LI>High-order byte first, native real format. 
  <LI>Low-order byte first, native real format. 
</UL>
<BR>
Note that any of the latter four values specifies the number representation
only for output. Incoming binary encoded numbers use a representation that
is specified as part of each token (in the initial token type character).
<BR>
The value 0 disables all binary encodings for both input and output. That
is, the PostScript language scanner treats all incoming characters as part
of the ASCII encoding, even if a token starts with a character code in the
range 128 to 159. <BR>
The printobject and writeobject operators are disabled; executing them will
cause an undefined error. This mode is provided for compatibility with certain
existing PostScript language programs. The initial value of this parameter
is implementation dependent. A program must execute setobjectformat to generate
output with a predictable number representation. <BR>
Modifications to the object format parameter obey save and restore. In a

<B>setpacking</B> bool setpacking - LEVEL 2 <BR>
<BR>
sets the array packing mode to the specified boolean value. This determines
the type of executable arrays subsequently created by the PostScript language
scanner. The value true selects packed arrays; false selects ordinary arrays.
The packing mode affects only the creation of procedures by the scanner
when it encounters program text bracketed by { and } during interpretation
of an executable file or string object, or during execution of the token
operator. <BR>
It does not affect the creation of literal arrays by the [ and ] operators
or by the array operator. Modifications to the array packing mode parameter
obey save and restore. In a Display PostScript system, which supports multiple
contexts, this parameter is maintained seperately for each context. <BR>
<BR>

systemdict /setpacking known <BR>
{/savepacking currentpacking def true setpacking } if <BR>
...Arbitrary procedure definitions<BR>
... systemdict /setpacking known {savepacking setpacking} if <BR>
<BR>
This illustrates how to use packed arrays in a way that is compatible with
Level 1 and Level 2 interpreters. If the packed array facility is available,
the procedures represented by &quot;arbitrary procedure definitions&quot;
are defined as packed arrays; otherwise, they are defined as ordinary arrays.
This example is careful to preserve the array packing mode in effect before
its execution. <BR>

<HR><A NAME="setpagedevice"></A><BR>
<B>setpagedevice</B> dict setpagedevice - LEVEL 2 <BR>
<BR>
installs a new raster output device in the graphics state based on a combination
of the information in the current device and the information found in the
dictionary operand. <BR>
The dictionary is a container for communicating requests as property-value
pairs, which are logically passed by value and copied by the setpagedevice
machinery into internal storage. <BR>
Calls to setpagedevice are cumulative: information established in a previous
call to setpagedevice will persist unless overridden explicitly in a subsequent
call. <BR>
Therefore, there are no required keys in any particular call. This behavior
applies not only to the top-level dictionary, but recursively to the sub-dictionaries
Policies, InputAttributes, and OutputAttributes. <BR>
The result of executing setpagedevice is to instantiate a device, perform
the equivalent of initgraphics and erasepage, and install the device as
an implicit part of the graphics state. The effects of setpagedevice are
subject to save and restore, gsave and grestore, and setgstate. setpagedevice
can be used by system administrators to establish a default state of the
device by executing it as part of an unencapsulated job. <BR>
This default state persists until the next restart of the PostScript interpreter.
Some PostScript interpreter implementations store some of the device values
in persistent storage when setpagedevice is executed as part of an unencapsulated
job, making those parameters persist through interpreter restart. setpagedevice
reinitializes everything in the graphics state, including parameters not
affected by initgraphics. Device-dependent rendering parameters, such as
halftone, transfer functions, flatness, and color rendering, are reset to
built-in default values or to ones provided in the Install procedure of
the page device dictionary. <BR>
When the device in the current graphics state is not a page device, such
as after <A HREF="PSL2no.html#nulldevice">nulldevice</A> has been executed,
or when an interactive display device is active, setpagedevice creates a
new device from scratch before merging in the parameters from dict. The
properties of that device are specific to each implementation. <BR>

the areas of the page that are to be painted. <BR>
The pattern operand is a pattern dictionary and instantiated by makepattern.
setpattern is a convenience operator that sets the current color space to
Pattern, then sets the current &quot;color&quot; to a specific pattern.
Normally, setpattern establishes a Pattern color space whose underlying
color space parameter is the color space in effect prior to execution of
setpattern. <BR>
However, if the current color space is already a Pattern color space, setpattern
leaves it unchanged. setpattern then invokes setcolor with the operands
given to setpattern. <BR>
The behavior depends on the PaintType entry of the pattern dictionary: 
<UL>
  <LI>If pattern defines a colored pattern (PaintType is 1), the color of
the pattern is part of the pattern itself; there are no underlying color
components. <BR>
Therefore, the comp1 ... compn operands of setpattern should not be specified.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>If pattern defines an uncolored pattern (PaintType is 2), the pattern
itself has no color; the color must be specified separately by the operands
comp1 ... compn, interpreted as components of the underlying color space
of the Pattern color space. 
</UL>
If the Pattern color space does not have an underlying color space parameter,
a <A HREF="PSL2qr.html#rangecheck">rangecheck</A> error occurs. <BR>

any marks painted on the current page to appear. showpage then executes
the equivalent of <A HREF="PSL2e.html#erasepage">erasepage</A> (usually)
and <A HREF="PSL2ik.html#initgraphics">initgraphics</A> (always) in preparation
for composing the next page. <BR>
If the device is a page device that was installed by setpagedevice (a Level
2 feature), the detailed behavior of showpage is determined by parameters
of the device dictionary . <BR>
The main actions are as follows: 
<UL>
  <LI>showpage executes the EndPage procedure in the device dictionary.
It passes two operands to EndPage, a page count and a reason indicator.
The EndPage procedure is expected to return a boolean result. The default
EndPage procedure always returns true. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>If the result from EndPage is true, showpage transmits the page to
the output device and executes the equivalent of erasepage. If the result
is false, showpage does not transmit the page or execute an <A HREF="PSL2e.html#erasepage">erasepage</A>.
<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>showpage executes the equivalent of <A HREF="PSL2ik.html#initgraphics">initgraphics</A>.
<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>showpage executes the BeginPage procedure in the device dictionary,
passing it a page-count operand. 
</UL>
<BR>
For a device that produces physical output, such as printed paper, showpage
optionally produces multiple copies of each page as part of transmitting
it to the output device (step 2, above). The number of copies is specified
in one of two ways. If the device dictionary contains a NumCopies entry
whose value is a nonnegative integer, that is the number of copies. <BR>
Otherwise, showpage looks up the value of #copies in the environment of
the dictionary stack. The default value of #copies is 1, defined in <A HREF="PSL2u.html#userdict">userdict</A>.
The #copies method for specifying number of copies is available in Level
1 implementations. The behavior of showpage is further modified by the Collate,
Duplex, and perhaps other entries in the device dictionary. <BR>
Whether or not the device is a page device, the precise manner in which
the current page is transmitted is device dependent. For certain devices,
such as displays, no action is required because the current page is visible
while it is being composed. <BR>
<BR>
EXAMPLE:<BR>
<BR>
/#copies 5 def showpage <BR>
<BR>
This prints five copies of the current page, then erases the current page
and initializes the graphics state. <BR>

startjob performs the following actions: <BR>
<BR>
1. Ends the current job-in other words, resets the stacks and, if the current
job was encapsulated, executes a restore. <BR>
2. Begins a new job. If the bool operand is true, the usual save at the

<B>stop</B> - stop <BR>
<BR>
- terminates execution of the innermost, dynamically enclosing instance
of a stopped context, without regard to lexical relationship. <BR>
A stopped context is a procedure or other executable object invoked by the
stopped operator. stop pops the execution stack down to the level of the
stopped operator. The interpreter then pushes the boolean true on the operand
stack and resumes execution at the next object in normal sequence after
the stopped. It thus appears that stopped returned the value true, whereas
it normally returns false. stop does not affect the operand or dictionary
stacks. <BR>
Any objects pushed on those stacks during the execution of the stopped context
remain after the context is terminated. If stop is executed when there is
no enclosing stopped context, the interpreter prints an error message and
executes the built-in operator <A HREF="PSL2qr.html#quit">quit</A>. This
never occurs during execution of ordinary user programs. <BR>

returns false on the operand stack. <BR>
If any terminates prematurely as a result of executing stop, stopped returns
true on the operand stack. Regardless of the outcome, the interpreter resumes
execution at the next object in normal sequence after stopped. <BR>
This mechanism provides an effective way for a PostScript language program
