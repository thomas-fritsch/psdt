<A NAME="packedarray"></A><BR>
<B>packedarray</B> any0 ... anyn-1 n packedarray packedarray LEVEL 2 <BR>
<BR>
creates a packed <A HREF="PSL2a.html#array">array</A> object of length n
containing the objects any0 through anyn-1 as elements. packedarray first
removes the non-negative integer n from the operand stack. It then removes
that number of objects from the operand stack, creates a packed array containing
those objects as elements, and finally pushes the resulting packed array
object on the operand stack. <BR>
<BR>
The resulting object has a type of packedarraytype, a literal attribute,
and readonly access. In all other respects, its behavior is identical to
that of an ordinary array object. <BR>
v The packed array is allocated in local or global VM according to the current
VM allocation mode. An <A HREF="PSL2ik.html#invalidaccess">invalidaccess</A>
error occurs if the packed array is in global VM and any of any0 ... anyn-1
are in local VM. <BR>

<HR><A NAME="pathbbox"></A><BR>
<B>pathbbox</B> - pathbbox llx lly urx ury <BR>
<BR>
returns the bounding box of the current path in the current user coordinate
system. The results are four real numbers: lower-left x, lower-left y, upper-right
x, and upper-right y. These coordinates describe a rectangle, oriented with
its sides parallel to the x and y axes in user space, that completely encloses
all elements of the path. If the current path is empty, pathbbox executes
the error <A HREF="PSL2no.html#nocurrentpoint">nocurrentpoint</A>. <BR>
<BR>
pathbbox first computes the bounding box of the current path in device space.
It then transforms these coordinates to user space by the inverse of CTM
and computes the bounding box of the resulting figure in user space. If
the user coordinate system is rotated (other than by multiples of 90 degrees)
or skewed, pathbbox may return a bounding box that is larger than expected.
<BR>
<BR>
If the path includes curve segments, the bounding box encloses the control
points of the curves as well as the curves themselves. To obtain a bounding
box that fits the path more tightly, one should first &quot;flatten&quot;
the curve segments by executing <A HREF="PSL2f.html#flattenpath">flattenpath</A>.
<BR>
<BR>
In Level 2 implementations of the PostScript language, if the current path
ends with a <A HREF="PSL2m.html#moveto">moveto</A>, the bounding box does
not necessarily include it, unless the moveto is the only element of the
path. If an explicit bounding box has been established by <A HREF="PSL2s.html#setbbox">setbbox</A>,
pathbbox returns a result derived from that bounding box, not from the actual
path. <BR>

<BR>
<HR><A NAME="pathforall"></A><BR>
<B>pathforall</B> move line curve close pathforall <BR>
- removes four operands from the stack, all of which must be procedures.
pathforall then enumerates the current path in order, executing one of the
four procedures for each element in the path. The four basic kinds of elements
in a path are <A HREF="PSL2m.html#moveto">moveto</A>, <A HREF="PSL2l.html#lineto">lineto</A>,
<A HREF="PSL2c.html#curveto">curveto</A>, and <A HREF="PSL2c.html#closepath">closepath</A>.
The relative variants <A HREF="PSL2qr.html#rmoveto">rmoveto</A>, <A HREF="PSL2qr.html#rlineto">rlineto</A>,
and <A HREF="PSL2qr.html#rcurveto">rcurveto</A> are converted to the corresponding
absolute forms; <A HREF="PSL2a.html#arc">arc</A>, <A HREF="PSL2a.html#arcn">arcn</A>,
and <A HREF="PSL2a.html#arcto">arcto</A> are converted to sequences of <A HREF="PSL2c.html#curveto">curveto</A>.
For each element in the path, pathforall pushes the element's coordinates
on the operand stack and executes one of the four procedures as follows:
<BR>
<BR>
moveto push x y; execute move<BR>
lineto push x y; execute line<BR>
curveto push x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3; execute curve<BR>
closepath execute close <BR>
<BR>
The operands passed to the procedures are coordinates in user space. pathforall
transforms them from device space to user space using the inverse of the
CTM. Ordinarily, these coordinates will be the same as the ones originally
entered by moveto, lineto, and so forth. However, if the CTM has been changed
since the path was constructed, the coordinates reported by pathforall will
be different from those originally entered. <BR>
<BR>
Among other uses, pathforall enables a path constructed in one user coordinate
system to be read out in another user coordinate system. <BR>
<BR>
pathforall enumerates the current path existing at the time it begins execution.
If any of the procedures change the current path, such changes do not alter
the behavior of pathforall. <BR>
<BR>
If <A HREF="PSL2c.html#charpath">charpath</A> was used to construct any
portion of the current path from a font whose outlines are protected, pathforall
is not allowed. Its execution will produce an <A HREF="PSL2ik.html#invalidaccess">invalidaccess</A>
error (see <A HREF="PSL2c.html#charpath">charpath</A>). <BR>

<B>print</B> string print <BR>
- writes the characters of string to the standard output file. The print
operator provides the simplest means to send text to an application or an
interactive user. Note that print is a file operator that has nothing to
do with painting character shapes on the current page (see <A HREF="PSL2s.html#show">show</A>)
or with sending the current page to a raster output device (see <A HREF="PSL2s.html#showpage">showpage</A>).

<A HREF="#printobject">printobject</A> <BR>
<HR><A NAME="printobject"></A><BR>
<B>printobject</B> obj tag printobject - LEVEL 2 <BR>
writes a binary object sequence to the standard output file. The binary
object sequence contains a top-level array whose length is one; its single
element is an encoding of obj. If obj is composite, the binary object sequence
also includes subsidiary array and string values for the components of obj.
<BR>
The tag operand, which must be an integer in the range 0 to 255, is used
to tag the top-level object; it appears as the second byte of the object's
representation.<BR>
Tag values 0 through 249 are available for general use;<BR>
tag values 250 through 255 are reserved for special purposes, such as reporting
errors. <BR>
<BR>
The binary object sequence uses the number representation established by
the most recent execution of setobjectformat. The token type given as the
first byte of the binary object sequence reflects the number representation
that was used. If the object format parameter has been set to zero, printobject
executes an <A HREF="PSL2u.html#undefined">undefined</A> error. <BR>
<BR>
The object obj and its components must be of type null, integer, real, name,
boolean, string, array, or mark. Appearance of an object of any other type,
including packed array, will result in a typecheck error. If arrays are
nested too deeply or are cyclical, a <A HREF="PSL2l.html#limitcheck">limitcheck</A>
error occurs. <BR>
<BR>
printobject always encodes a name object as a reference to a text name in
the string value portion of the binary object sequence, never as a system
or user name index. <BR>
<BR>
As is the case for all operators that write to files, the output produced
by printobject may accumulate in a buffer instead of being transmitted immediately.
To ensure immediate transmission, a flush is required. This is particularly
important in situations where the output produced by printobject is the
response to a query from the application. <BR>

<HR><A NAME="put"></A><BR>
<B>put</B> array index any put - <BR>
dict key any put - <BR>
string index int put -<BR>
<BR>
replaces a single element of the value of an array, dictionary, or string.
<BR>
<BR>
If the first operand is an array or string, put treats the second operand
as an index and stores the third operand at the position identified by the
index, counting from zero. index must be in the range 0 to n-1,where n is
the length of the array or string. If it is outside this range, put will
execute a <A HREF="PSL2qr.html#rangecheck">rangecheck</A> error. <BR>
<BR>
If the first operand is a dictionary, put uses the second operand as a key
and the third operand as a value, and it stores this key-value pair into
dict. If key is already present as a key in dict, put simply replaces its
value by any. Otherwise, put creates a new entry for key and associates
any with it. In Level 1 implementations, if dict is already full, put executes
the error <A HREF="PSL2d.html#dictfull">dictfull</A>. <BR>
<BR>
If the value of array or dict is in global VM and any is a composite object
whose value is in local VM, an <A HREF="PSL2ik.html#invalidaccess">invalidaccess</A>
error occurs. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
replaces a subsequence of the elements of the first operand by the entire
contents of the third operand. The subsequence that is replaced begins at
the specified index in the first operand; its length is the same as the
length of the third operand. <BR>
<BR>
The objects are copied from the third operand to the first, as if by a sequence
of individual gets and puts. In the case of arrays, if the copied elements
are themselves composite objects, the values of those objects are shared
between array2 and array1.<BR>
<BR>
putinterval requires index to be a valid index in array1 or string1 such
that index plus the length of array2 or string2 is not greater than the
length of array1 or string1. <BR>
<BR>
If the value of array1 is in global VM and any of the elements copied from
array2 or packedarray2 are composite objects whose values are in local VM,
