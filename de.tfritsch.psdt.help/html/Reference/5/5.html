	<h2>5.5 Font Cache</h2>
	<p>
		The PostScript interpreter includes an internal data structure called
		the <i>font cache</i> whose purpose is to make the process of painting
		glyphs very efficient. For the most part, font cache operation is
		automatic. However, fonts whose glyph descriptions are PostScript
		procedures, such as Type 3 fonts, must adhere to certain conventions
		to take advantage of the font cache. Also, there are several operators
		that control the behavior of the font cache, including ones that
		directly update the font cache on behalf of a Type 4 CIDFont.
	</p>
	<p>Rendering a glyph from an outline or other high-level
		description is a relatively costly operation, because it involves
		performing scan conversion of arbitrary shapes. This presents special
		problems for printing text, because it is common for several thousand
		glyphs to appear on a single page. However, a page description that
		includes large amounts of text normally has many repetitions of the
		same glyph in a given font, size, and orientation. The number of
		distinct glyphs thus is very much smaller than the total number of
		glyphs.</p>
	<p>The font cache operates by saving the results of glyph scan
		conversions (including metric information and device pixel arrays) in
		temporary storage and using those saved results when the same glyph is
		requested again. The font cache is usually large enough to accommodate
		all of the distinct glyphs in a page description. Painting a glyph
		that is already in the font cache is typically hundreds of times
		faster than scan-converting it from the glyph description in the font.</p>
	<p>
		The font cache does not retain color information; it remembers only
		which pixels were painted and which pixels were left unchanged within
		the glyph's bounding box. For this reason, there are a few
		restrictions on the set of graphical operators that may be executed as
		part of glyph descriptions that are to be cached. In particular, the <a
			href="../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator is not permitted.
		However, <a href="../../8/2/i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a> may be
		used to define a glyph according to a bitmap representation; see
		Secti1on <a href="../../4/10.html">4.10, "Images."</a> Execution of
		operators that specify colors or other color-related parameters in the
		graphics state is also not permitted; see Section <a
			href="../../4/8.html">4.8, "Color Spaces."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The principal manifestation of the font cache visible to the
		PostScript program is that showing a glyph does not necessarily result
		in the execution of the glyph's description. This means that glyph
		descriptions that are PostScript procedures must interact with the
		font cache machinery to ensure that the results of their execution are
		properly saved; this interaction is accomplished by means of the <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setcachedevice.html">setcachedevice</a> or <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setcachedevice2.html">setcachedevice2</a> operator,
		as described in Section <a href="7.html">5.7, "Type 3 Fonts."</a>
	</p>
	<p>Each glyph saved in the font cache is identified by the
		combination of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The original base font or CIDFont dictionary from which the
			glyph description was obtained.</li>
		<li>The <i>character selector</i>, which is a character name in a
			base font or a CID (character identifier) in a CIDFont; see Section <a
			href="11.html">5.11, "CID-Keyed Fonts."</a>
		</li>
		<li>The current transformation matrix (CTM) at the time the glyph
			is shown.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To ensure predictable behavior despite font caching, a given
		combination of font and character selector must always produce the
		same appearance when rendered. Means exist to provide reliable
		identification of a font definition; see the next section. Note that a
		character code is not part of the glyph identification in the font
		cache, since a given glyph may be selected in more than one way.</p>
