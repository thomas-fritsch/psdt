	<h2>5.1 Organization and Use of Fonts</h2>
	<p>
		A <i>character</i> is an abstract symbol, whereas a <i>glyph</i> is a
		specific rendering of a character. For example, the glyphs A, <b>A</b>,
		and <i>A</i> are renderings of the abstract "A" character.
		Historically these two terms have often been used interchangeably in
		computer typography (as evidenced by the names chosen for some
		PostScript operators and keys), but advances in this area have made
		the distinction more meaningful in recent times. Consequently this
		book distinguishes between characters and glyphs, though with some
		residual names that are inconsistent.
	</p>
	<p>
		Glyphs are organized into <i>fonts</i>. A font defines glyphs for a
		particular character set; for example, the Helvetica and Times-Roman
		fonts define glyphs for a set of standard Latin characters. A font for
		use with the PostScript interpreter is prepared in the form of a
		program. When such a <i>font program</i> is introduced into a
		PostScript interpreter, its execution causes a <i>font dictionary</i>
		to come into existence and to be associated with a font name.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the PostScript language, the term <i>font</i> refers to a font
		dictionary, through which the PostScript interpreter obtains <i>glyph
			descriptions</i> that generate glyphs. For each glyph to be painted, a
		program specifies a font dictionary and (usually) a character code to
		select the glyph description that represents the character. The glyph
		description, which is usually encoded in a special compact
		representation, consists of a sequence of graphics operators that
		produce the specific shape for that character in this font. To render
		a glyph, the PostScript interpreter executes the glyph description.
	</p>
	<p>If you have experience with scan conversion of general shapes,
		you may be concerned about the amount of computation that this
		description seems to imply. However, this is only the abstract
		behavior of glyph descriptions and font programs, not how they are
		implemented. In fact, the PostScript font machinery works very
		efficiently.</p>
