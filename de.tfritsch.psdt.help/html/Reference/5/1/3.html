	<h3>5.1.3 Achieving Special Graphical Effects</h3>
	<p>Normal uses of show and other glyph-painting operators cause
		black-filled glyphs to be painted. Other effects can be obtained by
		combining font operators with general graphics operators.</p>
	<p>
		The color used for painting glyphs is the current color in the
		graphics state. The default color is black, but other colors can be
		obtained by executing <a href="../../8/2/s/setgray.html">setgray</a>
		or some other color-setting operator before painting glyphs. Example
		5.3 paints glyphs in 50 percent gray, as shown in Figure 5.2.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 5.3</b>
	</p>
	<pre>/Helvetica-Bold findfont 48 scalefont setfont
20 40 moveto
.5 setgray
(ABC) show</pre>

	<p>
		More general graphical manipulations can be performed by treating the
		glyph outline as a path instead of immediately painting it. <a
			href="../../8/2/c/charpath.html">charpath</a> is a path construction
		operator that appends the outlines of one or more glyphs to the
		current path in the graphics state. This is useful mainly with glyphs
		that are defined as outlines (as are most standard fonts). Paths
		derived from glyphs defined as strokes can be used in limited ways. It
		is not possible to obtain paths for glyphs defined as images or
		bitmaps; <a href="../../8/2/c/charpath.html">charpath</a> produces an
		empty path. Also, a path consisting of the outlines of more than a few
		glyphs is likely to exceed the limit on number of path elements (see
		Appendix B). If possible, it is best to deal with only one glyph's
		path at a time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Example 5.4 treats glyph outlines as a path to be stroked. This
		program uses <a href="../../8/2/c/charpath.html">charpath</a> to
		obtain the outlines for the string of characters ABC in the current
		font. (The <i>false</i> operand to <a href="../../8/2/c/charpath.html">charpath</a>
		is explained in the description of <a href="../../8/2/c/charpath.html">charpath</a>
		in Chapter 8.) The program then strokes this path with a line 2 points
		thick, rendering the glyph outlines on the page (see Figure 5.3).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 5.4</b>
	</p>
	<pre>/Helvetica findfont 48 scalefont setfont
20 38 moveto
(ABC) false charpath
2 setlinewidth stroke</pre>

		<img src="figure-5.3.png" />

	</figure>
	<p>Example 5.5 obtains the glyphs' path as before, then establishes
		it as the current clipping path. All subsequent painting operations
		will mark the page only within this path, as illustrated in Figure
		5.4. This state persists until some other clipping path is
		establishedâ€”for example, by the grestore operator.</p>
