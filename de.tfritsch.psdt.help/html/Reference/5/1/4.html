	<h3>5.1.4 Glyph Positioning</h3>
	<p>
		A glyph's <i>width</i> is the amount of space the glyph occupies along
		the baseline of a line of text. In other words, it is the distance the
		current point moves when the glyph is shown. Note that the width is
		distinct from the dimensions of the glyph outline (see Section <a
			href="../4.html">5.4, "Glyph Metric Information"</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		In some fonts, the width is constant; it does not vary from glyph to
		glyph. Such fonts are called <i>fixed-pitch</i> or <i>monospaced</i>.
		They are used mainly for typewriter-style printing. However, most
		fonts used for high-quality typography associate a different width
		with each glyph. Such fonts are called <i>proportional</i> fonts or <i>variable-pitch</i>
		fonts. In either case, the <a href="../../8/2/s/show.html">show</a>
		operator positions the glyphs for consecutive characters of a string
		according to their widths.
	</p>
	<p>
		The width information for each glyph is stored in the font dictionary.
		A PostScript program can use any of several glyph-painting
		operators&mdash;<a href="../../8/2//.html">show</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/x/xshow.html">xshow</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/y/yshow.html">yshow</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/x/xyshow.html">xyshow</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/w/widthshow.html">widthshow</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/a/ashow.html">ashow</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/a/awidthshow.html">awidthshow</a>&mdash;to obtain a
		variety of width modification effects. If necessary, it can execute <a
			href="../../8/2/s/stringwidth.html">stringwidth</a> to obtain the
		width information itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		The standard operators for showing text (<a
			href="../../8/2/s/show.html">show</a> and its variants) are designed
		on the assumption that glyphs are ordinarily shown with their standard
		metrics. (See Section <a href="../4.html">5.4, "Glyph Metric
			Information"</a>.) However, means are provided to vary the metrics in
		certain limited ways. For example, the <a
			href="../../8/2/a/ashow.html">ashow</a> operator systematically
		adjusts the widths of all the glyphs it paints. The optional <b>Metrics</b>
		entry of a font dictionary can be added to adjust the widths of all
		instances of particular glyphs of a font.
	</p>
	<p>
		Certain applications that show text require very precise control of
		the positioning of each glyph. There are three LanguageLevel 2
		operators to streamline the operation of showing individually
		positioned glyphs: <a href="../../8/2/x/xyshow.html">xyshow</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/x/xshow.html">xshow</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/y/yshow.html">yshow</a>. Each operator is given a
		string of text to be shown, the same as <a
			href="../../8/2/s/show.html">show</a>. In addition, it expects a
		second operand, which is either an array of numbers or a string that
		can be interpreted as an encoded number string, as described in
		Section <a href="../../3/14/5.html">3.14.5, "Encoded Number
			Strings."</a> The numbers are used in sequence to control the widths of
		the glyphs being shown. <i>They completely override the standard
			widths of the glyphs.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/k/kshow.html">kshow</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/c/cshow.html">cshow</a> operators provide ways for an
		arbitrary PostScript procedure to intervene in the positioning and
		painting of each glyph they show. <a href="../../8/2/c/cshow.html">cshow</a>
		is a LanguageLevel 2 operator. These are the most general but least
		efficient glyph-painting operations.
