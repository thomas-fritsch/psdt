	<h3>5.1.1 The Basics of Showing Text</h3>
	<p>Example 5.1 illustrates the most straightforward use of a font.
		Suppose you want to place the text ABC 10 inches from the bottom of
		the page and 4 inches from the left edge, using 12-point Helvetica.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 5.1</b>
	</p>
	<pre>/Helvetica findfont
12 scalefont setfont
288 720 moveto
(ABC) show</pre>
	<p>The four lines of this program perform the following steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Select the font to use.</li>
		<li>Scale it to the desired size and install it as the font
			parameter in the graphics state.</li>
		<li>Specify a starting position on the page.</li>
		<li>Paint the glyphs for a string of characters there.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The following paragraphs explain these operations in more
		detail.</p>
	<p>
		Each PostScript implementation includes a collection of fonts that are
		either built in or can be obtained automatically from sources such as
		disks or cartridges. A user can download additional fonts, and a
		PostScript program can define special fonts for its own use. The
		interpreter maintains a <i>font directory</i> associating the names of
		fonts, which are name objects, with their definitions, which are font
		dictionaries. The <a href="../../8/2/f/findfont.html">findfont</a>
		operator takes the name of the font and returns on the operand stack a
		font dictionary containing all the information the PostScript
		interpreter needs to render any of that font's glyphs.
	</p>
	<p>A font defines the glyphs for one standard size. This standard
		is so arranged that the nominal height of tightly spaced lines of text
		is 1 unit. In the default user coordinate system, this means the
		standard glyph size is 1 unit in user space, or 1⁄72 inch. The
		standard-size font must then be scaled to be usable.</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/s/scalefont.html">scalefont</a> operator scales
		the glyphs in a font without affecting the user coordinate system. <a
			href="../../8/2/s/scalefont.html">scalefont</a> takes two operands:
		the original font dictionary and the desired scale factor. It returns
		a new font dictionary that defines glyphs in the desired size. It is
		possible to scale the user coordinate system with the coordinate
		system operators, but it is usually more convenient to encapsulate the
		desired size in the font dictionary. Another operator, <a
			href="../../8/2/m/makefont.html">makefont</a>, applies more
		complicated linear transformations to a font.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Example 5.1, the <a href="../../8/2/s/scalefont.html">scalefont</a>
		operator scales the Helvetica font left on the stack by <a
			href="../../8/2/f/findfont.html">findfont</a> to a 12-unit size and
		returns the scaled font on the operand stack. The <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setfont.html">setfont</a> operator establishes the
		resulting font dictionary as the font parameter in the graphics state.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the font has been selected, scaled, and set, it can be used to
		paint glyphs. The moveto operator (described in Section <a
			href="../../4/4.html">4.4, "Path Construction"</a>) sets the current
		position to the specified <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates&mdash;in
		units of 1⁄72 inch&mdash;in the default user coordinate system. This
		determines the position on the page at which to begin painting glyphs.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/s/show.html">show</a> operator takes a string
		from the operand stack and paints the corresponding glyphs using the <i>current
			font</i> (usually the font parameter most recently established in the
		graphics state by <a href="../../8/2/s/setfont.html">setfont</a>). The
		show operator treats each element of the string (an integer in the
		range 0 to 255) as a character code. Each code selects a glyph
		description in the font dictionary; the glyph description is executed
		to paint the desired glyph on the page. This is the behavior of <a
			href="../../8/2/s/show.html">show</a> for base fonts, such as
		ordinary Latin text fonts; interpretation of the <a
			href="../../8/2/s/show.html">show</a> string as a sequence of
		character codes is more complex for composite fonts, described in
		Section <a href="../../5/10.html">5.10, "Composite Fonts."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> What these steps produce on the page is not a
			12-point glyph, but rather a 12- unit glyph, where the unit size is
			that of the user space at the time the glyphs are rendered on the
			page. If the user space is later scaled to make the unit size 1
			centimeter, showing glyphs from the same 12-unit font will generate
			results that are 12 centimeters high.</i>
