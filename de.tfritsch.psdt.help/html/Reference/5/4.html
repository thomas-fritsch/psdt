	<h2>5.4 Glyph Metric Information</h2>
	<p>
		The <i>glyph coordinate system</i> is the space in which an individual
		character's glyph is defined. All path coordinates and metrics are
		interpreted in glyph space. Figure 5.6 shows a typical glyph outline
		and its metrics.

	<p>The glyph origin, or reference point, is the point (0, 0) in the
		glyph coordinate system. show and other glyph-painting operators
		position the origin of the first glyph to be shown at the current
		point in user space. For example,</p>
	<pre>40 50 moveto
(ABC) show</pre>
	<p>places the origin of the A at coordinate (40, 50) in the user
		coordinate system.</p>
	<p>
		The <i>glyph width</i> is the distance from the glyph's origin to the
		point at which the origin of the next glyph should normally be placed
		when painting the consecutive glyphs of a word. This distance is a
		vector in the glyph coordinate system; it has <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
		components. Most Indo-European alphabets, including the Latin
		alphabet, have a positive <i>x</i> width and a zero <i>y</i> width.
		Semitic alphabets have a negative <i>x</i> width, and some Asian
		writing systems have a nonzero <i>y</i> width.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <i>glyph bounding box</i> is the smallest rectangle (oriented with
		the axes of the glyph coordinate system) that will just enclose the
		entire glyph shape. The bounding box is expressed in terms of its
		left, bottom, right, and top coordinates relative to the glyph origin
		in the glyph coordinate system.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <i>left sidebearing</i> of a glyph is the position of the left
		sidebearing point in glyph space. This is usually the intersection of
		the left edge of the bounding box with the glyph's baseline; however,
		the exact interpretation of the left sidebearing depends on details of
		the font technology (for Type 1, see <a
			href="https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF">Adobe
			Type 1 Font Format</a>). Note that the <i>x</i> coordinate of the left
		sidebearing can be negative for glyphs that extend to the left of
		their origin. The <i>y</i> coordinate is almost always 0.
	</p>
	<p>
		Type 1 fonts are defined in such a way that a glyph's left sidebearing
		and width can be adjusted; that is, the glyph bounding box and the
		position of the next glyph can be shifted relative to the origin (see
		Section <a href="9.html">5.9, "Font Derivation and Modification"</a>).
		Some other types of base fonts work similarly.
	</p>
	<p>In some writing systems, text is frequently aligned in two
		different directions. For example, it is common to write Japanese and
		Chinese glyphs either horizontally or vertically. To handle this, a
		font can optionally contain a second set of metrics for each glyph.
		This feature is available only in LanguageLevel 2 or 3 or in
		LanguageLevel 1 implementations with composite font extensions.</p>
	<p>
		The metrics are accessed by <a href="../../8/2/s/show.html">show</a>
		and other operators according to a writing mode, given by a <b>WMode</b>
		entry in the font dictionary (or in some parent font dictionary in a
		composite font). By convention, writing mode 0 (the default) specifies
		horizontal writing and mode 1 specifies vertical writing. If a font
		contains only one set of metrics, the <b>WMode</b> parameter is
		ignored.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a glyph has two sets of metrics, each set specifies a glyph
		origin and a width vector. Figure 5.7 illustrates the relationship
		between the two sets of metrics. The left diagram illustrates the
		glyph metrics associated with writing mode 0. The coordinates <i>ll</i>
		and <i>ur</i> specify the bounding box of the glyph relative to origin
		0. <i>w0</i> is the glyph width vector that specifies how the current
		point is changed after the glyph is shown in writing mode 0. The
		center diagram illustrates writing mode 1; <i>w1</i> is the glyph
		width vector for writing mode 1. In the right diagram, <i>v</i> is a
		vector defining the position of origin 1 relative to origin 0.

	<p>
		Glyph metric information can be accessed procedurally by a PostScript
		program. The <a href="../../8/2/s/stringwidth.html">stringwidth</a>
		operator obtains glyph widths. The sequence
	</p>
	<pre>charpath flattenpath pathbbox</pre>
	<p>
		computes glyph bounding boxes, though this is relatively inefficient.
		The bounding box for an entire font appears in the font dictionary as
		an array of four numbers associated with the key <b>FontBBox</b>.
	</p>
	<p>Glyph metric information is also available separately in the
		form of Adobe font metrics (AFM) and Adobe composite font metrics
		(ACFM) files. These files are for use by application programs that
		generate PostScript page descriptions and must make formatting
		decisions based on the widths and other metrics of glyphs. Kerning
		information is also available in the AFM and ACFM files. When
		possible, applications should use this information directly instead of
		generating PostScript instructions to compute it.</p>
	<p>
		Specifications for the AFM and ACFM file formats are available in <a
			href="https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/5004.AFM_Spec.pdf">Adobe
			Technical Note #5004, Adobe Font Metrics File Format Specification</a>.
