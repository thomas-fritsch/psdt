	<h2>5.2 Font Dictionaries</h2>
	<p>Font dictionaries are ordinary dictionary objects, but with
		certain special entries. The PostScript language has several operators
		that deal with font dictionaries (see Chapter 8). Some of the contents
		of a font dictionary are optional and userdefinable, while other
		entries must be present and have the correct semantics in order for
		the PostScript interpreter’s font machinery to operate properly.</p>
	<p>
		In addition to fonts, LanguageLevel 3 supports two classes of
		font-related objects, called CIDFonts and CMaps, described in Section
		<a href="11.html">5.11, "CID-Keyed Fonts."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		There are several kinds of fonts, distinguished by the <b>FontType</b>
		entry in the font dictionary. Each type of font has its own
		conventions for organizing and representing the information within it.
		Fonts of type 1, 2, 3, 14, and 42 are called base fonts. The standard
		font types defined at present are listed in Table 5.1.
	</p>

					format that allows the generation of a wide variety of typeface
					styles from a single font. For details of the construction and uses

				specified by a separate <b>CIDFontType</b> entry; a Type 0 font and
				a Type 0 CIDFont are entirely different kinds of objects. CIDFonts
				are not considered to be base fonts.</td>

	<p>Some products support proprietary font types in addition to the
		standard ones built into the PostScript language. These
		product-specific font types are not described in this book, but rather
		in the manufacturer’s documentation for individual products.</p>
	<p>
		As stated earlier, most fonts (and related objects, such as CIDFonts
		and CMaps) originate as programs contained in files that conform to an
		external specification, such as <a
			href="https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF">Adobe
			Type 1 Font Format</a>. There are two main ways in which such a font
		program can be introduced into a PostScript interpreter, causing a
		font dictionary to be created in virtual memory:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Execution of the <a href="../8/2/f/findfont.html">findfont</a>
			operator causes the interpreter to locate a font file in external
			storage and to load its definition into VM on demand.
		</li>
		<li>The PostScript program defines the font explicitly, by
			including a copy of the font file embedded directly within the job.
			(To facilitate document management, a PostScript program containing
			an embedded font program should use appropriate document structuring
			comments; see Adobe Technical Note #5001, <a
			href="https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/ps/5001.DSC_Spec.pdf">PostScript
				Language Document Structuring Conventions Specification</a>.)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In either case, the PostScript interpreter executes the font program.
		For some font types, a font program consists entirely of ordinary
		operators, such as <a href="../8/2/d/dict.html">dict</a>, <a
			href="../8/2/b/begin.html">begin</a>, <a href="../8/2/e/end.html">end</a>,
		and <a href="../8/2/d/def.html">def</a>, that construct the font
		dictionary directly. For other font types, a font program invokes a
		special-purpose operator, such as <b>StartData</b>, that interprets
		binary-encoded font data appearing in-line and constructs a font
		dictionary using material extracted from that data.
	</p>
	<p>
		The font program makes the new font dictionary known to the
		interpreter by executing the <a href="../8/2/d/definefont.html">definefont</a>
		operator. <a href="../8/2/d/definefont.html">definefont</a> takes a
		name and a dictionary, checks that the dictionary is a well-formed
		font dictionary, makes the dictionary's access read-only, and
		associates the font name with the dictionary in the font directory. It
		performs additional modifications that are documented in the <a
			href="../8/2/d/definefont.html">definefont</a> operator description
		in Chapter 8. Successful execution of <a
			href="../8/2/d/definefont.html">definefont</a> makes the font
		dictionary valid for use by other font operators (an <a
			href="../8/2/i/invalidfont.html">invalidfont</a> error will occur
		otherwise).
	</p>
	<p>
		The operator <a href="../8/2/u/undefinefont.html">undefinefont</a> <i>(LanguageLevel
			2)</i> removes a named font from the font directory. A font dictionary
		that has been removed in this fashion is still a valid font (assuming
		it is still accessible), but it can no longer be returned by <a
			href="../8/2/f/findfont.html">findfont</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevels 2 and 3, fonts are actually a special case of named
		resources: a font is an instance of the <b>Font</b> resource category.
		The <a href="../8/2/f/findfont.html">findfont</a>, <a
			href="../8/2/d/definefont.html">definefont</a>, and <a
			href="../8/2/u/undefinefont.html">undefinefont</a> operators are
		merely conveniences for invoking <a href="../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a>,
		<a href="../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>, and <a
			href="../8/2/u/undefineresource.html">undefineresource</a>. Other
		classes of font-related objects, CIDFonts and CMaps, are ordinarily
		defined as instances of separate resource categories, not the <b>Font</b>
		category (however, a CIDFont can be an instance of the <b>Font</b>
		category). Like fonts, these objects become valid as a side effect of
		successful execution of <a href="../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A font dictionary can reside in either local or global VM. See Section
		<a href="../3/9.html">3.9, "Named Resources,"</a> and the description
		of the <a href="../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>
		operator for complete information on how resource instances are named
		and are loaded into VM.
