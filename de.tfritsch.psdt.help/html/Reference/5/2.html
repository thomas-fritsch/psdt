	<h2>5.2 Font Dictionaries</h2>
	<p>Font dictionaries are ordinary dictionary objects, but with
		certain special entries. The PostScript language has several operators
		that deal with font dictionaries (see Chapter 8). Some of the contents
		of a font dictionary are optional and userdefinable, while other
		entries must be present and have the correct semantics in order for
		the PostScript interpreter’s font machinery to operate properly.</p>
	<p>In addition to fonts, LanguageLevel 3 supports two classes of
		font-related objects, called CIDFonts and CMaps, described in Section
		5.11, "CID-Keyed Fonts."</p>
	<p>
		There are several kinds of fonts, distinguished by the <b>FontType</b>
		entry in the font dictionary. Each type of font has its own
		conventions for organizing and representing the information within it.
		Fonts of type 1, 2, 3, 14, and 42 are called base fonts. The standard
		font types defined at present are listed in Table 5.1.

	</table>
	<p>Some products support proprietary font types in addition to the
		standard ones built into the PostScript language. These
		product-specific font types are not described in this book, but rather
		in the manufacturer’s documentation for individual products.</p>
	<p>As stated earlier, most fonts (and related objects, such as
		CIDFonts and CMaps) originate as programs contained in files that
		conform to an external specification, such as Adobe Type 1 Font
		Format. There are two main ways in which such a font program can be
		introduced into a PostScript interpreter, causing a font dictionary to
		be created in virtual memory:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Execution of the <b>findfont</b> operator causes the
			interpreter to locate a font file in external storage and to load its
			definition into VM on demand.
		</li>
		<li>The PostScript program defines the font explicitly, by
			including a copy of the font file embedded directly within the job.
			(To facilitate document management, a PostScript program containing
			an embedded font program should use appropriate document structuring
			comments; see Adobe Technical Note #5001, PostScript Language
			Document Structuring Conventions Specification.)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In either case, the PostScript interpreter executes the font program.
		For some font types, a font program consists entirely of ordinary
		operators, such as <b>dict</b>, <b>begin</b>, <b>end</b>, and <b>def</b>,
		that construct the font dictionary directly. For other font types, a
		font program invokes a special-purpose operator, such as <b>StartData</b>,
		that interprets binary-encoded font data appearing in-line and
		constructs a font dictionary using material extracted from that data.
	</p>
	<p>
		The font program makes the new font dictionary known to the
		interpreter by executing the <b>definefont</b> operator. <b>definefont</b>
		takes a name and a dictionary, checks that the dictionary is a
		well-formed font dictionary, makes the dictionary's access read-only,
		and associates the font name with the dictionary in the font
		directory. It performs additional modifications that are documented in
		the <b>definefont</b> operator description in Chapter 8. Successful
		execution of <b>definefont</b> makes the font dictionary valid for use
		by other font operators (an <b>invalidfont</b> error will occur
		otherwise).
	</p>
	<p>
		The operator <b>undefinefont</b> <i>(LanguageLevel 2)</i> removes a
		named font from the font directory. A font dictionary that has been
		removed in this fashion is still a valid font (assuming it is still
		accessible), but it can no longer be returned by <b>findfont</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevels 2 and 3, fonts are actually a special case of named
		resources: a font is an instance of the Font resource category. The <b>findfont</b>,
		<b>definefont</b>, and <b>undefinefont</b> operators are merely
		conveniences for invoking <b>findresource</b>, <b>defineresource</b>,
		and <b>undefineresource</b>. Other classes of font-related objects,
		CIDFonts and CMaps, are ordinarily defined as instances of separate
		resource categories, not the <b>Font</b> category (however, a CIDFont
		can be an instance of the <b>Font</b> category). Like fonts, these
		objects become valid as a side effect of successful execution of <b>defineresource</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A font dictionary can reside in either local or global VM. See Section
		3.9, "Named Resources," and the description of the <b>defineresource</b>
		operator for complete information on how resource instances are named
		and are loaded into VM.
	</p>
	<h3>5.2.1 Entries in Font Dictionaries</h3>
	<p>Table 5.2 lists the entries that have defined meanings in the
		font dictionaries of all types of fonts. Table 5.3 lists additional
		entries that are meaningful in all base fonts (fonts of type 1, 2, 3,
		14, or 42). On top of that, Table 5.4 lists additional entries that
		are meaningful in Type 1 fonts; most of them apply to other base font
		formats as well. Entries specific to other types of fonts (and to
		CIDFonts and CMaps) are described later in the sections that discuss
		those types. Any font dictionary can have additional entries
		containing information useful to PostScript procedures that are part
		of the font’s definition; the interpreter pays no attention to such
		entries.</p>

				Adobe are usually defined in terms of a 1000-unit glyph coordinate
				system, and their initial font matrix is [0.001 0 0 0.001 0 0]. When
				a font is derived by the <b>scalefont</b> or <b>makefont</b>
				operator, the new matrix is concatenated with the existing font
				matrix to yield a new copy of the font with a different font matrix.
			</td>

		<tr>
			<td><b>FontName</b></td>
			<td>name</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> The name of the font. This entry is for

		<a name="LanguageLevel"></a>
		<tr>
			<td><b>LanguageLevel</b></td>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> The minimum LanguageLevel required for
				correct behavior of the font. For example, any font that uses
				LanguageLevel 2 features for rendering glyphs (such as a glyph
				description that uses <b>rectfill</b> or <b>glyphshow</b>) should
				specify a <b>LanguageLevel</b> value of 2. On the other hand, the
				presence of higher-LanguageLevel information that an interpreter can
				safely ignore does not require LanguageLevel to be set to the higher
				LanguageLevel. For example, an <b>XUID</b> entry in the font
				dictionary&mdash;LanguageLevel 2 information that a LanguageLevel 1
				interpreter can ignore&mdash;does not require setting <b>LanguageLevel</b>
				to 2. Default value: 1.</td>

		<tr>
			<td><b>WMode</b></td>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Optional; LanguageLevel 2)</i> The writing mode, which
				determines which of two sets of metrics will be used when glyphs are
				shown from the font. Mode 0 specifies horizontal writing; mode 1
				specifies vertical writing (see Section 5.4, "Glyph Metric
				Information"). LanguageLevel 1 implementations lacking composite
				font extensions ignore this entry. Default value: 0.</td>

				the dictionary presented to definefont; the dictionary must have
				sufficient space to insert this entry.</td>

			<td><b>FontBBox</b></td>
			<td>array</td>
			<td><i>(Required)</i> An array of four numbers in the glyph
				coordinate system giving the left, bottom, right, and top
				coordinates, respectively, of the font bounding box. The font
				bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape that
				would result if all of the glyphs of the font were placed with their
				origins coincident, and then painted. This information is used in
				making decisions about glyph caching and clipping. If all four
				values are 0, the PostScript interpreter makes no assumptions based
				on the font bounding box.
				<P>If any value is nonzero, it is essential that the font
					bounding box be accurate; if any glyph's marks fall outside this
					bounding box, incorrect behavior may result.
				<P>
					In many Type 1 fonts, the <b>FontBBox</b> array is executable,
					though there is no good reason for this to be so. Programs that
					access <b>FontBBox</b> should invoke an explicit <b>get</b> or <b>load</b>

	<p>
		The PostScript language does not specify any formal rules for the
		names of fonts or for the entries in the <b>FontInfo</b> dictionary.
		However, there are various conventions for organizing fonts that
		facilitate their use by application programs.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some applications use <b>FamilyName</b> as part of a
			hierarchical font-selection user interface. This divides a very large
			set of individual fonts into a smaller, more manageable set of "font
			families." The <b>FamilyName</b> parameter should be suitable for use
			in a font selection menu.
		</li>
		<li>Typically, <b>FullName</b> begins with <b>FamilyName</b> and
			continues with various style descriptors separated by
			spaces&mdash;for example, <code>Adobe Garamond Bold Italic</code>. In
			some designs, a numbering system replaces or augments verbal
			descriptors&mdash; for example, <code>Univers 55 Medium</code>.
		</li>
		<li><b>Weight</b> is derived from the <b>FullName</b> parameter
			by dropping everything from <b>FullName</b> that does not explicitly
			relate to weight. For example, the <b>FullName</b> entry <code>ITC
				Franklin Gothic Condensed Extra Bold Oblique</code> reduces to a <b>Weight</b>
			entry of <code>Extra Bold</code>.</li>
		<li>The font dictionary's <b>FontName</b> parameter, which is
			also usually used as the key passed to <b>definefont</b>, is a
			condensation of <b>FullName</b>. It is customary to remove spaces and
			to limit its length to fewer than 40 characters. The resulting name
			should be unique.
		</li>
	</ul>
