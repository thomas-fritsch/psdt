	<h3>5.7.2 BuildChar</h3>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 2 or 3, if there is no <b>BuildGlyph</b> procedure
		for the font, the interpreter calls the <b>BuildChar</b> procedure
		instead. In LanguageLevel 1, <b>BuildChar</b> is always called,
		whether or not a <b>BuildGlyph</b> procedure is present.
	</p>
	<p>
		The semantics of <b>BuildChar</b> are essentially the same as for <b>BuildGlyph</b>.
		The only difference is that <b>BuildChar</b> is called with the font
		dictionary and the character code on the operand stack, instead of the
		font dictionary and the character name. The <b>BuildChar</b> procedure
		must then perform its own lookup to determine what glyph description
		corresponds to the given character code.
	</p>
	<p>
		For backward compatibility with the installed base of LanguageLevel 1
		interpreters, all new Type 3 fonts should contain the following <b>BuildChar</b>
		procedure:
	</p>
	<pre>/BuildChar
    { 1 index /Encoding get exch get
      1 index /BuildGlyph get exec
    } bind def</pre>
	<p>
		This defines <b>BuildChar</b> in terms of the same font's <b>BuildGlyph</b>
		procedure, which contains the actual commands for painting the glyph.
		This permits the font to be used with higher-LanguageLevel
		features&mdash;such as the LanguageLevel 2 operator <a
			href="../../8/2/g/glyphshow.html">glyphshow</a>, which requires <b>BuildGlyph</b>
		to be present&mdash;yet retains compatibility with LanguageLevel 1.
