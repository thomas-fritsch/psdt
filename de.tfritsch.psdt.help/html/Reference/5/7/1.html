	<h3>5.7.1 BuildGlyph</h3>
	<p>When a PostScript program tries to show a glyph from a Type 3
		font, and the glyph is not already present in the font cache, the
		PostScript interpreter:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Uses the character code as an index into the current font's <b>Encoding</b>
			array, obtaining the corresponding character name. (This step is
			omitted during a <a href="../../8/2/g/glyphshow.html">glyphshow</a>
			operation.)
		</li>
		<li>Pushes the current font dictionary and the character name on
			the operand stack.</li>
		<li>Executes the font’s <b>BuildGlyph</b> procedure. <b>BuildGlyph</b>
			must remove these two objects from the operand stack and use this
			information to construct the requested glyph. This typically involves
			determining the glyph description needed, supplying glyph metric
			information, constructing the glyph, and painting it.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		All Type 3 fonts must include a character named .notdef. The <b>BuildGlyph</b>
		procedure should be able to accept that character name regardless of
		whether such a character is encoded in the <b>Encoding</b> array. If
		the <b>BuildGlyph</b> procedure is given a character name it does not
		recognize, it can handle that condition by painting the glyph for the
		.notdef character instead.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>BuildGlyph</b> is called within the confines of a <a
			href="../../8/2/g/gsave.html">gsave</a> and a <a
			href="../../8/2/g/grestore.html">grestore</a>, so any changes it
		makes to the graphics state do not persist after it finishes. Each
		call to <b>BuildGlyph</b> is independent of any other call. Because of
		the effects of font caching, no assumptions can be made about the
		order in which glyph descriptions will be executed. In particular, <b>BuildGlyph</b>
		should not depend on any nonconstant information in VM, and it should
		not leave any side effects in VM or on stacks.
	</p>
	<p>
		When <b>BuildGlyph</b> gets control, the current transformation matrix
		(CTM) is the concatenation of the font matrix (<b>FontMatrix</b> in
		the current font dictionary) and the CTM that was in effect at the
		time <a href="../../8/2/s/show.html">show</a> was invoked. This means
		that shapes described in the glyph coordinate system will be
		transformed into the user coordinate system and will appear in the
		appropriate size and orientation on the page. <b>BuildGlyph</b> should
		describe the glyph in terms of absolute coordinates in the glyph
		coordinate system, placing the glyph origin at (0, 0) in this space.
		It should make no assumptions about the initial value of the current
		point parameter.
	</p>
	<p>
		The results of <b>BuildGlyph</b> should depend only on the complete
		transformation from glyph space to device space, and not on the
		relative contributions of the font matrix and the CTM prior to <b>BuildGlyph</b>.
		In particular, <b>BuildGlyph</b> should not attempt to vary its
		results depending on the font dictionary’s <b>FontMatrix</b> entry.
	</p>
	<p>
		Aside from the CTM, the graphics state is inherited from the
		environment of the <a href="../../8/2/s/show.html">show</a> operator
		(or show variant) that caused <b>BuildGlyph</b> to be invoked. To
		ensure predictable results despite font caching, <b>BuildGlyph</b>
		must initialize any graphics state parameters on which it depends. In
		particular, if it invokes the <a href="../../8/2/s/stroke.html">stroke</a>
		operator, <b>BuildGlyph</b> should explicitly set the line width, line
		join, line cap, and dash pattern to appropriate values. Normally, it
		is unnecessary and undesirable to initialize the current color
		parameter, because <b>show</b> is defined to paint glyphs with the
		current color.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>BuildGlyph</b> must execute one of the following operators to pass
		width and bounding box information to the PostScript interpreter. This
		must precede execution of any path construction or painting operators
		describing the glyph.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/s/setcachedevice.html">setcachedevice</a>
			establishes a single set of metrics for both writing modes, and
			requests that the interpreter save the results in the font cache if
			possible.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/s/setcachedevice2.html">setcachedevice2</a>
			<i>(LanguageLevel 2)</i> establishes separate sets of metrics for
			writing modes 0 and 1, and requests that the interpreter save the
			results in the font cache.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/s/setcharwidth.html">setcharwidth</a>
			passes just the glyph's width (to be used only once), and requests
			that the glyph not be cached. This operator is typically used only if
			the glyph description includes operators to set the color explicitly.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		See the descriptions of <a href="../../8/2/s/setcachedevice.html">setcachedevice</a>,
		<a href="../../8/2/s/setcachedevice2.html">setcachedevice2</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setcharwidth.html">setcharwidth</a> in Chapter 8
		for more information.
	</p>
	<p>
		After executing one of these operators, <b>BuildGlyph</b> should
		execute a sequence of graphics operators to perform path construction
		and painting. The PostScript interpreter transfers the results into
		the font cache, if appropriate, and onto the page at the correct
		position. It also uses the width information to control the spacing
		between this glyph and the next. The final position of the current
		point in the glyph coordinate system does not influence glyph spacing.
