	<h2>5.3 Character Encoding</h2>
	<p>
		Font definitions use a flexible <i>encoding</i> scheme by which
		character codes select glyph descriptions. The association between
		character codes and glyph descriptions is not part of the glyph
		descriptions themselves, but instead is described by a separate
		encoding vector. A PostScript program can change a font's <i>encoding
			vector</i> to match the requirements of the application generating the
		description.
	</p>
	<p>
		This section describes the character encoding scheme used with base
		fonts. Composite fonts (Type 0) use a more complicated character
		mapping algorithm, as discussed in Section <a href="10.html">5.10,
			"Composite Fonts."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Every base font must have an Encoding entry, which
			the PostScript font machinery accesses automatically as described
			below. A Type 3 font's <b>BuildChar</b> procedure should use this
			entry in the standard way; see Section <a href="7.html">5.7,
				"Type 3 Fonts."</a></i>
	</p>
	<p>
		In a font dictionary, the descriptions of the individual glyphs are
		keyed by character <i>names</i>, not by character <i>codes</i>.
		Character names are ordinary PostScript name objects. Descriptions of
		Latin alphabetic characters are normally associated with names
		consisting of single letters, such as A or a. Other characters are
		associated with names composed of words, such as three, ampersand, or
		parenleft.
	</p>
	<p>
		The encoding vector is defined by the array object that is the value
		of the <b>Encoding</b> entry in the font dictionary. The array is
		indexed by character code (an integer in the range 0 to 255). The
		elements of the array must be character names, and the array should be
		256 elements long. (A base font used as a descendant in a composite
		font may be accessed using a code that is not 8 bits long, in which
		case the length of the <b>Encoding</b> array should be correspondingly
		different.)
	</p>
	<p>
		The operand to the <a href="../../8/2/s/show.html">show</a> operator
		is a PostScript string object. Each element of the string is treated
		as a character code. When <a href="../../8/2/s/show.html">show</a>
		paints a character:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>It uses the character code as an index into the current
			font's <b>Encoding</b> array to obtain a character name.
		</li>
		<li>It invokes the glyph description by name. For a Type 1 font,
			it looks up the name in the font's <b>CharStrings</b> dictionary to
			obtain an encoded glyph description (called a <i>charstring</i>),
			which it executes; Figure 5.5 illustrates this common case. For a
			Type 3 font, it calls the font's <b>BuildGlyph</b> procedure (if
			present) with the name as its operand; see Section <a href="7.html">5.7,
				"Type 3 Fonts."</a> Other types of fonts have their own conventions for
			associating character names with glyph descriptions.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		For example, in the standard encoding vector used by Type 1 Latin-text
		fonts such as Helvetica, the element at index 38 is the name object
		ampersand. When show encounters the value 38 (the ASCII character code
		for &amp;) as an element of a string it is printing, it fetches the
		encoding vector entry at index 38, obtaining the name object
		ampersand. It then uses ampersand as a key in the current font
		dictionary's <b>CharStrings</b> subdictionary and executes the
		associated charstring that renders the &amp; glyph.
	</p>
	<p>
		Changing an existing font's encoding involves creating a new font
		dictionary that is a copy of the existing one except for its <b>Encoding</b>
		entry. The subsidiary dictionaries, such as <b>CharStrings</b> and <b>FontInfo</b>,
		continue to be shared with the original font. Of course, a new font
		may be created with any desired encoding vector. This flexibility in
		character encoding is valuable for two reasons:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It permits showing text that is encoded according to any of
			the various existing conventions. For example, the Microsoft Windows
			and Apple Mac OS operating systems use different standard encodings
			for Latin text, and many applications use their own special-purpose
			encodings.</li>
		<li>It allows applications to specify how characters selected
			from a large character set are to be encoded. Some character sets
			consist of more than 256 characters, including ligatures, accented
			characters, and other symbols required for highquality typography or
			non-Latin writing systems. Different encodings can select different
			subsets of the same character set.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Latin-text font programs produced by Adobe Systems use the "Adobe
		standard" encoding vector, which is associated with the name <a
			href="../../8/2/s/StandardEncoding.html">StandardEncoding</a> in <a
			href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>. An alternate
		encoding vector called ISO Latin-1 is associated with the name <a
			href="../../8/2/i/ISOLatin1Encoding.html">ISOLatin1Encoding</a>.
		Complete details of these encodings and of the characters present in
		typical fonts are provided in Appendix E.
	</p>
	<p>All unused positions in an encoding vector must be filled with
		the character name .notdef. Like any other character name, the name
		.notdef is defined in the CharStrings dictionary. If an encoding maps
		to a character name that does not exist in the font, the name .notdef
		is substituted. Every font must contain a glyph description for the
		.notdef character. The effect produced by showing the .notdef
		character is at the discretion of the font designer. In Type 1 font
		programs produced by Adobe, it is the same as the space character.</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/g/glyphshow.html">glyphshow</a> operator <i>(LanguageLevel
			2)</i> shows the glyph for a single character specified by name instead
		of by character code. This allows direct access to any character in
		the font regardless of the font's <b>Encoding</b> array. The principal
		use of <a href="../../8/2/g/glyphshow.html">glyphshow</a> is in
		defining fonts whose glyph descriptions refer to other characters in
		the same or a different font. Referring to such characters by name
		ensures proper behavior if the font is subsequently reencoded.
