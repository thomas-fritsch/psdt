	<h2>5.7 Type 3 Fonts</h2>
	<p>A Type 3 font is one whose behavior is determined entirely by
		PostScript procedures. In contrast, most other types of base fonts
		originate as font programs that conform to an external specification,
		such as Adobe Type 1 Font Format, that has no direct connection with
		the PostScript language. This section describes how to build a Type 3
		font from scratch.</p>
	<p>In addition to the entries common to all base fonts (Table 5.2
		on page 324 and Table 5.3 on page 325), a Type 3 font dictionary
		includes the entries listed in Table 5.6.</p>
	<table>

			fonts</caption>
		<tr>

		<tr id="BuildGlyph">
			<th>BuildGlyph</th>
			<td>procedure</td>
			<td><i>(Optional; LanguageLevel 2)</i> A procedure that
				constructs the requested glyph. The font dictionary, followed by the
				character name, is on the stack when the procedure is called. See
				Section <a href="7/1.html">5.7.1, "BuildGlyph."</a></td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="BuildChar">
			<th>BuildChar</th>
			<td>procedure</td>
			<td><i>(Required for LanguageLevel 1 or if <b>BuildGlyph</b>
					is absent)
			</i> A procedure that constructs the requested glyph (only if no <b>BuildGlyph</b>
				entry is present, in LanguageLevel 2 or 3). The font dictionary,
				followed by the character code, is on the stack when the procedure
				is called. See Section <a href="7/2.html">5.7.2, "BuildChar."</a></td>
