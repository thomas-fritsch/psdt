	<h3>5.2.1 Entries in Font Dictionaries</h3>
	<p>Table 5.2 lists the entries that have defined meanings in the
		font dictionaries of all types of fonts. Table 5.3 lists additional
		entries that are meaningful in all base fonts (fonts of type 1, 2, 3,
		14, or 42). On top of that, Table 5.4 lists additional entries that
		are meaningful in Type 1 fonts; most of them apply to other base font
		formats as well. Entries specific to other types of fonts (and to
		CIDFonts and CMaps) are described later in the sections that discuss
		those types. Any font dictionary can have additional entries
		containing information useful to PostScript procedures that are part
		of the font’s definition; the interpreter pays no attention to such
		entries.</p>
	<table>
		<caption>TABLE 5.2: Entries common to all font dictionaries</caption>
		<tr>
			<th>Key</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="FontType">FontType</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Required)</i> The font type; see Table 5.1. Indicates
				where the glyph descriptions are to be found and how they are
				represented.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="FontMatrix">FontMatrix</th>
			<td>array</td>
			<td><i>(Required)</i> An array that transforms the <i>glyph
					coordinate system</i> into the user coordinate system (see Section <a
				href="../4.html">5.4, "Glyph Metric Information"</a>). For example,
				Type 1 font programs from Adobe are usually defined in terms of a
				1000-unit glyph coordinate system, and their initial font matrix is
				[0.001 0 0 0.001 0 0]. When a font is derived by the <a
				href="../../8/2/s/scalefont.html">scalefont</a> or <a
				href="../../8/2/m/makefont.html">makefont</a> operator, the new
				matrix is concatenated with the existing font matrix to yield a new
				copy of the font with a different font matrix.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="FontName">FontName</th>
			<td>name</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> The name of the font. This entry is for
				information only; it is not used by the PostScript interpreter.
				Ordinarily, it is the same as the key passed to <a
				href="../../8/2/d/definefont.html">definefont</a>, but it need not
				be.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="FontInfo">FontInfo</th>
			<td>dictionary</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A dictionary containing font information
				that is not accessed by the PostScript interpreter; see Table 5.5 on
				page 327.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="LanguageLevel">LanguageLevel</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> The minimum LanguageLevel required for
				correct behavior of the font. For example, any font that uses
				LanguageLevel 2 features for rendering glyphs (such as a glyph
				description that uses <a href="../../8/2/r/rectfill.html">rectfill</a>
				or <a href="../../8/2/g/glyphshow.html">glyphshow</a>) should
				specify a <b>LanguageLevel</b> value of 2. On the other hand, the
				presence of higher-LanguageLevel information that an interpreter can
				safely ignore does not require LanguageLevel to be set to the higher
				LanguageLevel. For example, an <b>XUID</b> entry in the font
				dictionary&mdash;LanguageLevel 2 information that a LanguageLevel 1
				interpreter can ignore&mdash;does not require setting <b>LanguageLevel</b>
				to 2. Default value: 1.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="WMode">WMode</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Optional; LanguageLevel 2)</i> The writing mode, which
				determines which of two sets of metrics will be used when glyphs are
				shown from the font. Mode 0 specifies horizontal writing; mode 1
				specifies vertical writing (see Section <a href="../4.html">5.4,
					"Glyph Metric Information"</a>). LanguageLevel 1 implementations
				lacking composite font extensions ignore this entry. Default value:
				0.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="FID">FID</th>
			<td>fontID</td>
			<td><i>(Inserted by <a href="../../8/2/d/definefont.html">definefont</a>)
			</i> A special object of type fontID that serves internal purposes in the
				font machinery. The <a href="../../8/2/d/definefont.html">definefont</a>
				operator inserts this entry. In LanguageLevel 1, an <b>FID</b> entry
				must not previously exist in the dictionary presented to <a
				href="../../8/2/d/definefont.html">definefont</a>; the dictionary
				must have sufficient space to insert this entry.</td>

		<caption>TABLE 5.3: Additional entries common to all base
			fonts</caption>
		<tr>
			<th>Key</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="Encoding">Encoding</th>
			<td>array</td>
			<td><i>(Required)</i> An array of character names to which
				character codes are mapped. See Section <a href="../3.html">5.3,
					"Character Encoding."</a></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="FontBBox">FontBBox</th>
			<td>array</td>
			<td><i>(Required)</i> An array of four numbers in the glyph
				coordinate system giving the left, bottom, right, and top
				coordinates, respectively, of the font bounding box. The font
				bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape that
				would result if all of the glyphs of the font were placed with their
				origins coincident, and then painted. This information is used in
				making decisions about glyph caching and clipping. If all four
				values are 0, the PostScript interpreter makes no assumptions based
				on the font bounding box.
				<P>If any value is nonzero, it is essential that the font
					bounding box be accurate; if any glyph's marks fall outside this
					bounding box, incorrect behavior may result.
				<P>
					In many Type 1 fonts, the <b>FontBBox</b> array is executable,
					though there is no good reason for this to be so. Programs that
					access <b>FontBBox</b> should invoke an explicit <b>get</b> or <b>load</b>
					operator to avoid unintended execution.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="UniqueUID">UniqueID</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> An integer in the range 0 to 16,777,215 (2<sup>24</sup>
				- 1) that uniquely identifies this font. See Section <a
				href="../6.html">5.6, "Unique ID Generation."</a></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="XUID">XUID</th>

				font are to be painted:
				<ol>
					<li value="0">Glyph outlines are filled.</li>
					<li value="2">Glyph outlines (designed to be filled) are
						stroked.</li>
				</ol> To get a stroked-outline font, a program can copy the font
				dictionary, change the <b>PaintType</b> from 0 to 2, add a <b>StrokeWidth</b>
				entry, and define a new font using this dictionary. Note that the
				previously documented <b>PaintType</b> values of 1 and 3 are not
				supported.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="StrokeWidth">StrokeWidth</th>
			<td>number</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> The stroke width (in units of the glyph
				coordinate system) for stroked-outline fonts (<b>PaintType</b> 2).
				This entry is not initially present in filled-outline fonts. It
				should be added (with a nonzero value) when a stroked font is
				created from an existing filled font. Default value: 0.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="Metrics">Metrics</th>
			<td>dictionary</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A dictionary containing metric information
				(glyph widths and sidebearings) for writing mode 0. This entry is
				not normally present in the original definition of a font. Adding a
				<b>Metrics</b> entry to a font overrides the metric information
				encoded in the glyph descriptions. See Sections <a href="../4.html">5.4,
					“Glyph Metric Information,”</a> and <a href="../9/2.html">5.9.2,
					"Changing Glyph Metrics."</a></td>

			<th id="CDevProc">CDevProc</th>
			<td>procedure</td>
			<td><i>(Optional; LanguageLevel 2)</i> A procedure that
				algorithmically derives global changes to the font's metrics.
				LanguageLevel 1 implementations lacking composite font extensions
				ignore this entry.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="CharStrings">CharStrings</th>
			<td>dictionary</td>
			<td><i>(Required)</i> A dictionary associating character names
				(the keys in the dictionary) with glyph descriptions. Each entry's
				value is ordinarily a string (called a charstring) that represents
				the glyph description for that character in a special encoded
				format; see <a
				href="https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF">Adobe
					Type 1 Font Format</a> for details. The value can also be a PostScript
				procedure; see Section <a href="../9/3.html">5.9.3, "Replacing
					or Adding Individual Glyphs."</a> This dictionary must have an entry
				whose key is .notdef.</td>

					Type 1 Font Format</a> for details.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="WeightVector">WeightVector</th>
			<td>dictionary</td>
			<td><i>(Required; multiple-master fonts only)</i> An array
				specifying the contribution of each master design to the current
				font instance. The array contains one number per master design, each
				typically in the range 0.0 to 1.0; the sum of the array elements
				must be 1.0. The values in the array are used for calculating the
				weighted interpolation. Elements outside the allowed range may
				produce unexpected results.</td>

		Any font dictionary can contain a <b>FontInfo</b> entry whose value is
		a dictionary containing the information listed in Table 5.5. This
		information is entirely for the benefit of PostScript programs using
		the font, or for documentation; it is not accessed by the PostScript
		interpreter, and all of its entries are optional.

	<p>
		The PostScript language does not specify any formal rules for the
		names of fonts or for the entries in the <b>FontInfo</b> dictionary.
		However, there are various conventions for organizing fonts that
		facilitate their use by application programs.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some applications use <b>FamilyName</b> as part of a
			hierarchical font-selection user interface. This divides a very large
			set of individual fonts into a smaller, more manageable set of "font
			families." The <b>FamilyName</b> parameter should be suitable for use
			in a font selection menu.
		</li>
		<li>Typically, <b>FullName</b> begins with <b>FamilyName</b> and
			continues with various style descriptors separated by
			spaces&mdash;for example, <code>Adobe Garamond Bold Italic</code>. In
			some designs, a numbering system replaces or augments verbal
			descriptors&mdash; for example, <code>Univers 55 Medium</code>.
		</li>
		<li><b>Weight</b> is derived from the <b>FullName</b> parameter
			by dropping everything from <b>FullName</b> that does not explicitly
			relate to weight. For example, the <b>FullName</b> entry <code>ITC
				Franklin Gothic Condensed Extra Bold Oblique</code> reduces to a <b>Weight</b>
			entry of <code>Extra Bold</code>.</li>
		<li>The font dictionary's <b>FontName</b> parameter, which is
			also usually used as the key passed to <b>definefont</b>, is a
			condensation of <b>FullName</b>. It is customary to remove spaces and
			to limit its length to fewer than 40 characters. The resulting name
			should be unique.
		</li>
	</ul>
