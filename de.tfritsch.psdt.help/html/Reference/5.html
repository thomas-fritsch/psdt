	<h1>5 Fonts</h1>
	<p>THIS CHAPTER DESCRIBES the special facilities in the PostScript
		language for dealing with text&mdash;more generally, for representing
		characters with glyphs from fonts. A glyph is a graphical shape and is
		subject to all graphical manipulations, such as coordinate
		transformation. Because of the importance of text in most page
		descriptions, the PostScript language provides higher-level facilities
		that permit a program to describe, select, and render glyphs
		conveniently and efficiently.</p>
	<p>The first section is a general description of how fonts are
		organized and accessed. This description covers all normal uses of
		fonts that are already installed.</p>
	<p>The information in subsequent sections is somewhat more complex,
		but is required only by programs with sophisticated needs. These
		sections discuss the organization of font dictionaries, the encoding
		scheme that maps character codes to character names and glyph
		descriptions, the metric information available for fonts, the
		operation of the font cache, and the construction of new fonts.</p>
	<p>Details of the individual PostScript operators are given in
		Chapter 8. All facilities are supported by LanguageLevel 1 except
		those specifically documented as LanguageLevel 2 or LanguageLevel 3
		features. Some of the LanguageLevel 2 features are also available as
		part of composite font extensions; see Appendix A for details.</p>
