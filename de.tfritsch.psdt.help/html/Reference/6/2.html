	<h2>6.2 Page Device Parameters</h2>
	<p>This section describes specific page device parameters that have
		been defined at the time of publication of this book. Table 6.1
		classifies them into general categories for easier understanding.
		(This classification is not rigid, however; parameters in different
		categories can sometimes interact with each other.) In the future,
		other parameters may be defined as needed to cover new processing
		options or device features. Once defined for any device, a given
		parameter name will always be used for the same feature in any
		subsequent devices that support it.</p>
	<p>
		<em><b>Note:</b> Excluded from the table (and from this chapter)
			are parameters that are device-specific, controlling features unique
			to a particular device or limited to only a few devices; for
			information on these, see the PostScript Language Reference
			Supplement and individual product documentation. Note also that not
			all parameters described here are supported by all devices; consult
			the product documentation for each device to see exactly which
			parameters it supports.</em>
