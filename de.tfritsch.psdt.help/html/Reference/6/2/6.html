	<table>
		<caption>TABLE 6.7 Page device parameters related to device
			initialization and page setup</caption>
		<tr>
			<th>Key</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th><a name="Install"></a>Install</th>
			<td>procedure</td>
			<td>A procedure to install parameter values in the
				graphics state during each invocation of <b>setpagedevice</b>. <b>setpagedevice</b>
				calls this procedure after setting up the device and installing it
				as the current device in the graphics state, but before invoking <b>erasepage</b>
				and <b>initgraphics</b>.
				<p>
					The <b>Install</b> procedure should not do anything besides alter
					parameters in the graphics state. In general, it can usefully alter
					only device-dependent parameters, because the succeeding <b>initgraphics</b>
					operation resets all deviceindependent parameters to their standard
					values. The only exception is the current transformation matrix;
					see the discussion following this table.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a device that supports in-RIP trapping (see Section 6.3, "In-RIP
					Trapping"), the <b>Install</b> procedure can invoke <b>settrapzone</b>
					to establish default trapping zones to be reestablished at the
					beginning of each page.
				</p>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th><a name="BeginPage"></a>BeginPage</th>
			<td>procedure</td>
			<td>A procedure to be executed at the beginning of
				each page. Before calling the procedure, the interpreter initializes
				the graphics state, erases the current page if appropriate, and
				pushes an integer on the operand stack indicating how many times <b>showpage</b>
				has been invoked since the current device was activated.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th><a name="EndPage"></a>EndPage</th>
			<td>procedure</td>
			<td>A procedure to be executed at the end of each
				page. Before calling the procedure, the interpreter pushes two
				integers on the operand stack&mdash;a count of previous <b>showpage</b>
				executions for this device and a reason code indicating the
				circumstances under which this call is being made:
				<ol start="0">
					<li>During <b>showpage</b> or <i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i> <b>copypage</b></li>
					<li>During <b>copypage</b> <i>(LanguageLevel 2 only)</i>
					</li>
					<li>At device deactivation</li>
