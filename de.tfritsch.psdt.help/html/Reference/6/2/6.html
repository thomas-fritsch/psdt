	<h3>6.2.6 Device Initialization and Page Setup</h3>
	<p>The page device parameters shown in Table 6.7 are PostScript
		procedures that are called by the interpreter at certain critical
		times: at the beginning and end of each page of a document and
		whenever the identity of the current page device changes. PostScript
		programs can use these parameters to perform needed tasks such as
		initializing the graphics state or painting recurrent elements that
		appear on every page.</p>

			initialization and page setup</caption>

			<th>Install</th>
			<td>procedure</td>
			<td>A procedure to install parameter values in the graphics
				state during each invocation of <a
				href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>. <a
				href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> calls this
				procedure after setting up the device and installing it as the
				current device in the graphics state, but before invoking <a
				href="../../8/2/e/erasepage.html">erasepage</a> and <a
				href="../../8/2/i/initgraphics.html">initgraphics</a>.
				<p>
					The <b>Install</b> procedure should not do anything besides alter
					parameters in the graphics state. In general, it can usefully alter
					only device-dependent parameters, because the succeeding <b>initgraphics</b>
					operation resets all deviceindependent parameters to their standard
					values. The only exception is the current transformation matrix;
					see the discussion following this table.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a device that supports in-RIP trapping (see Section 6.3, "In-RIP
					Trapping"), the <b>Install</b> procedure can invoke <a
						href="../../8/2/s/settrapzone.html">settrapzone</a> to establish
					default trapping zones to be reestablished at the beginning of each
					page.

	<p>
		Each time the <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
		operator is invoked, it calls the currently defined <b>Install</b>
		procedure. This gives the PostScript program an opportunity to
		initialize device-dependent graphics state parameters such as the
		halftone screen, color rendering dictionary, and flatness tolerance
		(see Table 4.2 on page 180). In general, the <b>Install</b> procedure
		cannot usefully alter device-independent graphics state parameters
		such as the current path or color (Table 4.1 on page 179), since these
		are reinitialized with the <a href="../../8/2/i/initgraphics.html">initgraphics</a>
		operator after the procedure is executed. An exception is the current
		transformation matrix; any new CTM set by the Install procedure
		becomes the default matrix for the device and will be used by <a
			href="../../8/2/i/initgraphics.html">initgraphics</a> in
		reinitializing the graphics state.
	</p>
	<p>
		The PostScript interpreter calls the current device's <b>BeginPage</b>
		and <b>EndPage</b> procedures, respectively, before beginning and
		after completing the execution of each page description. With suitable
		definitions, these procedures can:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cause multiple virtual pages within a document to be printed
			on a single physical page ("2-up" or "<i>n</i>-up" printing)
		</li>
		<li>Shift the positions of even- and odd-page images differently
			for binding</li>
		<li>Add marks to each page that either underlie or overprint the
			material provided by the page description</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The use of <b>BeginPage</b> and <b>EndPage</b> to
			achieve effects spanning multiple pages sacrifices any page
			independence the document may have. In general, a page description
			should not include definitions of <b>BeginPage</b> or <b>EndPage</b>
			in its invocations of <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>.
			Instead, a software print manager should prepend such commands to the
			page description when printing is requested.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The following descriptions refer to the <a
			href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a> operators. The
			distinction between those operators exists only in LanguageLevel 2;
			in LanguageLevel 3, the effects of <a
			href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a> on the device are the
			same as those of <a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a>.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>BeginPage</b> procedure is called at the beginning of each
		page:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
			normally calls <b>BeginPage</b> as its last action before returning
			(except for a possible call to the <b>PolicyReport</b> procedure, if
			needed; see Section 6.2.7, "Unsatisfied Parameter Requests"). This
			indicates the beginning of the first page to be rendered on the
			device.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a> call <b>BeginPage</b>
			as their last action before returning. This indicates the beginning
			of the next page, following the one that <a
			href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a> or <a
			href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a> has just ended.</li>
		<li>Operators that reactivate an existing page device call <b>BeginPage</b>
			as their last action before returning.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		When <b>BeginPage</b> is called, the graphics state has been
		initialized and the current page erased, if appropriate, in
		preparation for beginning the execution of the PostScript commands
		describing a page. The operand stack contains an integer stating the
		number of executions of <a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a>
		(but not <a href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a>) that have
		occurred since the current device was activated; that is, the operand
		is 0 at the first call to <b>BeginPage</b>, 1 at the call that occurs
		during the first execution of <a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a>,
		and so on. The <b>BeginPage</b> procedure is expected to consume this
		operand. The procedure is permitted to alter the graphics state and to
		paint marks on the current page.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>EndPage</b> procedure is called at the end of each page:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a> call EndPage as their
			first action. This indicates the end of the preceding page.</li>
		<li>Operators that deactivate the page device call <b>EndPage</b>
			as their first action.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		When <b>EndPage</b> is called, the PostScript commands describing the
		preceding page have been completely executed, but the contents of
		raster memory have not yet been transferred to the medium and the
		graphics state is undisturbed. The operand stack contains two
		integers:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The number of executions of <a
			href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a> (but not <a
			href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a>) that have occurred
			since the device was activated, not including this one. That is, the
			operand is 0 at the call to <b>EndPage</b> during the first execution
			of <a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a>, 1 during the
			second execution of <a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a>,
			and so on.
		</li>
		<li>A reason code indicating the circumstances under which <b>EndPage</b>
			is being called: 0 during <a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a>,
			1 during <a href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a>, 2 during
			device deactivation.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The <b>EndPage</b> procedure is expected to consume these operands.
		The procedure is permitted to alter the graphics state and to paint
		marks on the current page; such marks are added to the page just
		completed.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>EndPage</b> must return a boolean result specifying the disposition
		of the current page:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The value true means transfer the contents of raster memory
			to the medium. Then, if <a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a>
			is being executed, execute the equivalent of <a
			href="../../8/2/i/initgraphics.html">initgraphics</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/e/erasepage.html">erasepage</a> in preparation for
			the next page. (The latter actions are not performed during <a
			href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a>.)
		</li>
		<li>The value false means do not transfer the contents of raster
			memory to the medium or erase the current page. (If <a
			href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a> is being executed, <a
			href="../../8/2/i/initgraphics.html">initgraphics</a> is still
			performed; if the device is being deactivated, the page is still
			erased.)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The normal definition of <b>EndPage</b> returns true during <a
			href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a> or <a
			href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a> (reason code 0 or 1)
		but false during device deactivation (reason code 2). That is,
		normally every <a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a> or <a
			href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a> operation causes a
		physical page to be produced, but an incomplete last page (not ended
		by <a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a> or <a
			href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a>) produces no output.
		Other behavior can be obtained by defining <b>EndPage</b> differently.
	</p>
	<p>
		When <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> is
		executed or when <a href="../../8/2/r/restore.html">restore</a>, <a>grestore</a>,
		<a href="../../8/2/g/grestoreall.html">grestoreall</a> or <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setgstate.html">setgstate</a> causes a page device
		to be deactivated and a different page device to be activated, the
		interpreter takes the following actions:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Calls the <b>EndPage</b> procedure of the device being
			deactivated, passing it a reason code of 2. At the time this call is
			made, the current device in the graphics state is still the old
			device. This enables any necessary cleanup actions to be performed,
			such as printing an incomplete "<i>n</i>-up" page.
		</li>
		<li>Performs any actions needed on device deactivation, such as
			those indicated by the <b>Jog</b>, <b>AdvanceMedia</b>, and <b>CutMedia</b>
			page device parameters.
		</li>
		<li>If the <b>Duplex</b> page device parameter is <i>true</i> and
			the last sheet has been printed on only one side, delivers this final
			sheet.
		</li>
		<li>Calls the <b>BeginPage</b> procedure of the device being
			activated. At the time this call is made, the current device in the
			graphics state is the new one. Its count of previous <a
			href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a> executions is reset to
			0.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		With the exception of step 4 (which <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> always
		performs), these actions occur only when switching from one page
		device to another. They do not occur when the current device remains
		unchanged or when switching to or from devices of other kinds, such as
		the cache device or the null device set up by the <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setcachedevice.html">setcachedevice</a> or
		nulldevice operator. Usually, the latter devices are installed only
		temporarily; for example, <a href="../../8/2/s/setcachedevice.html">setcachedevice</a>
		and the operations for rendering a character into the font cache are
		bracketed by <a href="../../8/2/g/gsave.html">gsave</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/g/grestore.html">grestore</a>, thereby reinstating
		the page device that was previously in effect. The page device's <b>BeginPage</b>
		and <b>EndPage</b> procedures are not called in such cases and the
		current page is not erased or otherwise disturbed.
