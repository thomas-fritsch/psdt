	<table>
		<caption>TABLE 6.5 Page device parameters related to page
			delivery</caption>
		<tr>
			<th>Key</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr id="OutputDevice">
			<th>OutputDevice</th>
			<td>name or string</td>
			<td><i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i> The name of the output device for
				which this page description is destined. The name should match that
				of an instance of the <b>OutputDevice</b> resource category (see
				Section <a href="../4.html">6.4, "Output Device Dictionary"</a>). In
				environments in which the PostScript interpreter can generate output
				for multiple page devices, this parameter can be used to select
				between devices of different types (such as a printer and an
				imagesetter) or between similar devices (such as two or more
				imagesetters). In an interpreter that supports only a single page
				device, the <b>OutputDevice</b> parameter is typically absent.
				<p>
					When a request dictionary passed to <a
						href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> changes
					the value of <b>OutputDevice</b>, all other page device parameters
					not explicitly specified in the request dictionary are
					reinitialized to default values specific to the new device, rather
					than simply inheriting their previous values in the usual way. The
					set of valid page device parameters themselves may also change,
					since different devices have different configurable features.
				</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="OutputType">
			<th>OutputType</th>
			<td>string or null</td>
			<td>An arbitrary string representing special attributes of the
				output destination, analogous to the <b>MediaType</b> parameter for
				input (see Table 6.2 on page 400). If not null, this parameter is
				used in conjunction with <b>OutputAttributes</b> to select an
				appropriate output destination.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="NumCopies">
			<th>NumCopies</th>
			<td>integer or null</td>
			<td>The number of copies to produce, either of each page
				individually or of the document as a whole, depending on the value
				of the <b>Collate</b> parameter (see below). A null value indicates
				that the interpreter should consult the value associated with the
				name <b>#copies</b> in the current dictionary stack each time a page
				is printed (by <a href="../../8/2/s/showpage.html">showpage</a>, <a
				href="../../8/2/c/copypage.html">copypage</a>, or device
				deactivation); this is compatible with the LanguageLevel 1
				convention.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="Collate">
			<th>Collate</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>A flag specifying how the output is to be organized when
				multiple copies are requested (via <b>NumCopies</b> or <b>#copies</b>)
				for a multiple-page document. Output consists of page sets that are
				delivered together. If <b>Collate</b> is true, a page set consists
				of one copy of all pages of the document; if it is false, a page set
				consists of all copies of one page of the document.
				<p>
					If the <b>Collate</b> flag is true, the exact manner in which
					collation is performed is device-dependent. If the device has a
					physical sorting mechanism and the number of copies requested is no
					greater than the number of available sorting bins, the device
					itself handles the collation by mechanical means. Otherwise, the
					interpreter may need to reorder the output in order to deliver all
					pages of a set together. This may potentially require executing all
					page descriptions for the entire document and storing the results
					so that they can be delivered repeatedly to the printing engine in
					the correct order. This method of collation is supported by
					relatively few devices and is subject to resource limits in those
					that do support it.
				</p>
				<p>
					A collated page set can span multiple invocations of <a
						href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> within a
					single job, as long as the requested number of copies does not
					change and the device is physically capable of delivering the
					output in collated form. If this is not possible, the document is
					broken into sections determined by the device's collating capacity;
					pages are collated only within each section.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="Jog">
			<th>Jog</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td>A code specifying when output pages should be "jogged"
				(physically shifted in the output tray):
				<ol start="0">
					<li>Do not jog pages at all.</li>
					<li>Jog at device deactivation.</li>
					<li>Jog at the end of the job. Jogging between jobs is
						controlled by the value of <b>Jog</b> for the page device that is
						current between jobs. Thus, this feature can be turned on or off
						only by executing <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
						as part of an unencapsulated job.
					</li>
					<li>Jog after each page set (as defined by the <b>Collate</b>
						parameter).
					</li>
				</ol>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="OutputFaceUp">
			<th>OutputFaceUp</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>A flag specifying the order in which pages are stacked in
				the output tray. If this flag is true, pages are stacked with the
				back side of each page placed against the front of the previous
				page; the resulting stack is thus ordered backwards from normal
				reading order. If the flag is false, the pages are stacked with the
				front side of each page placed against the back of the previous
				page; this places the pages in correct reading order. These are the
				effects usually produced by face-up and face-down stackers,
				respectively; however, the name <b>OutputFaceUp</b> is a misnomer,
				since the parameter actually indicates stacking order rather than
				orientation. Most devices support only one or the other of these two
				stacking methods; relatively few can support both. The value of <b>OutputFaceUp</b>
				typically indicates the single stacking direction that the device
				supports.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="OutputAttributes">
			<th>OutputAttributes</th>
			<td>dictionary</td>
			<td>A dictionary specifying the attributes of all media
				destinations currently available for use by this output device. The
				dictionary contains an entry for each available destinationâ€”for
				example, each output paper tray on a printer. The key for each entry
				is an arbitrary integer position number; the value is a
				subdictionary describing the attributes of that destination. Each
				such subdictionary must include an <b>OutputType</b> entry, with the
				same meaning as the corresponding page device parameter described in
				this table. Two other optional entries, <b>Priority</b> and <b>MatchAll</b>,
				control details of the matching algorithm in a way analogous to the
				corresponding entries in an <b>InputAttributes</b> subdictionary;
				see "Matching Requests with Attributes" on page 403 for more
				information. The cumulative merging convention and the interaction
				with deferred media selection are also the same as for
				InputAttributes.
