	<h3>6.2.1 Media Selection</h3>
	<p>
		A given output device may support one or more physical sources for the
		media on which PostScript page descriptions are rendered. These <i>media
			sources</i> (often called trays or positions) are arbitrarily numbered by
		small integer position numbers. A position number usually designates a
		specific physical location in the hardware, though it may refer
		instead to some logical capability such as a pair of trays that
		contain the same medium and are used alternately. The correspondence
		between position numbers and media sources is device-dependent; it is
		not described in this book, but rather in individual product
		documentation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The page device parameters shown in Table 6.2 control the selection of
		an input media source. Some of these parameters (<b>PageSize</b>, <b>MediaColor</b>,
		<b>MediaWeight</b>, <b>MediaType</b>, <b>MediaClass</b>, <b>InsertSheet</b>)
		are used by a page description to specify its media requirements. The
		<b>InputAttributes</b> parameter describes the properties of the
		physical media currently available on the device. The <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> operator uses
		this information to match a page's requirements with the available
		media and decide which physical media source to use for that page. The
		remaining parameters in Table 6.2 specify additional requirements for
		input media handling that may also influence the media selection
		process.
	</p>
	<p>Media selection is performed according to one of two models:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Immediate media selection.</i> All information about the
			available media is present in the <b>InputAttributes</b> and other
			page device parameters at the time <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> is invoked. <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> uses this
			information, along with the policies established for handling
			unsatisfied parameter requests, to select a media source. The outcome
			of this decision is immediately visible to the PostScript program.</li>
		<li><i>Deferred media selection.</i> Information about the
			available media is not known at the time <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> is invoked.
			Instead of selecting the media source immediately, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> merely
			collects the selection requests and saves them for use at some later
			time when the page image is actually applied to the medium.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Most of this section is devoted to describing the immediate
		media selection process in detail. Deferred media selection is
		discussed in “Deferred Media Selection” on page 411.</p>
	<table>
		<caption>TABLE 6.2 Page device parameters related to media
			selection</caption>
		<tr>
			<th>Key</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr id="InputAttributes">
			<th>InputAttributes</th>
			<td>dictionary or null</td>
			<td>A dictionary specifying the attributes of all input media
				currently available for use by this output device. The dictionary
				contains an entry for each available media source on the
				device&mdash;for example, each input paper tray on a printer. The key
				for each entry is an arbitrary integer position number; the value is
				a subdictionary describing the medium currently available from that
				source. Entries in these subdictionaries include <b>PageSize</b>, <b>MediaColor</b>,
				<b>MediaWeight</b>, <b>MediaType</b>, <b>MediaClass</b>, and <b>InsertSheet</b>,
				with the same meanings as the corresponding page device parameters
				described in this table. Two other optional entries, <b>Priority</b>
				and <b>MatchAll</b>, control details of the matching algorithm; see
				"Matching Requests with Attributes" on page 403.
				<p>
					Changes to the contents of the <b>InputAttributes</b> dictionary
					are cumulative; that is, the <a
						href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> operator
					merges the contents of <b>InputAttributes</b> from the request
					dictionary with those of the existing <b>InputAttributes</b>
					dictionary for the current device. However, this cumulative merging
					is not recursive: the contents of subdictionaries representing
					individual media sources within the <b>InputAttributes</b>
					dictionary are replaced outright rather than merged.
				</p>
				<p>
					On devices that perform deferred media selection (see "Deferred
					Media Selection" on page 411), the PostScript interpreter has no
					prior knowledge of the available input media. In such cases, <b>InputAttributes</b>
					is either an empty dictionary or <i>null</i>. Instead of attempting
					to fulfill the PostScript program's input media requests, the <a
						href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> operator
					will then simply save them and pass them to the device's printing
					subsystem along with the contents of the rendered page image.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="PageSize">
			<th>PageSize</th>
			<td>array</td>
			<td>An array of two numbers, [<i>width height</i>], specifying
				the overall dimensions of the physical medium that were assumed
				during the generation of this page description. The dimensions are
				expressed in units of the default user space (72nds of an inch) and
				include any unprinted borders along the edges of the page; thus the
				lower-left and upper-right corner of the assumed physical page are
				at user space coordinates (0, 0) and (<i>width</i>, <i>height</i>),
				respectively.
				<p>
					The specified page dimensions are considered to match those of an
					available input medium if they are within a tolerance of 5 units in
					each dimension. (For roll-fed media, the tolerance applies only to
					the amount by which the requested size may exceed the actual size
					of the physical medium; it may be smaller by an unlimited amount.)
					The order in which the dimensions are specified is immaterial; that
					is, a requested page size of [<i>a b</i>] is considered to match an
					input medium whose dimensions are specified as [<i>b a</i>].
					Likewise, the physical orientation of the medium in the printing
					mechanism is unspecified and can vary from one device to another.
					The PostScript interpreter will set up the transformation from user
					space to device space so that the longer and shorter dimensions
					specified by PageSize are properly oriented with those of the
					physical medium.
				</p>
				<p>
					To allow pages of the same dimensions in portrait (height greater
					than width) and landscape (width greater than height) orientations
					to be interspersed on the same physical medium, the <a
						href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> operator
					rotates the default user space for landscape orientation 90 degrees
					counterclockwise with respect to that for portrait orientation.
					This relationship holds only for pages rendered on the same
					physical medium; no such relationship is guaranteed between
					different media. For roll-fed media, the page orientation is
					further determined by the <b>Orientation</b> page device parameter
					(see Table 6.3 on page 412).

		<tr id="MediaColor">
			<th>MediaColor</th>
			<td>string or null</td>
			<td>A string identifying the color of the medium.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="MediaWeight">
			<th>MediaWeight</th>
			<td>number or null</td>
			<td>The weight of the medium in grams per square meter. "Basis
				weight" or "ream weight" in pounds can be converted to grams per
				square meter by multiplying by 3.76; for example, 10-pound paper is
				approximately 37.6 grams per square meter.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="MediaType">
			<th>MediaType</th>
			<td>string or null</td>
			<td>An arbitrary string representing special attributes of the
				medium other than its size, color, and weight. This parameter can be
				used to identify special media such as envelopes, letterheads, or
				preprinted forms.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="MediaClass">
			<th>MediaClass</th>
			<td>string or null</td>
			<td><i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i> An arbitrary string representing
				attributes of the medium that may require special action by the
				output device, such as the selection of a color rendering
				dictionary. Devices should use the value of this parameter to
				trigger such media-related actions, reserving the <b>MediaType</b>
				parameter (above) for generic attributes requiring no
				device-specific action.
				<p>
					The <b>MediaClass</b> entry in the output device dictionary defines
					the allowable values for this parameter on a given device (see
					Section 6.4, "Output Device Dictionary"); attempting to set it to
					an unsupported value will cause a configuration error.
				</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="InsertSheet">
			<th>InsertSheet</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td><i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i> A flag specifying whether to insert
				a sheet of some special medium directly into the output document.
				Media coming from a source for which this attribute is <i>true</i>
				are sent directly to the output bin without passing through the
				device's usual imaging mechanism (such as the fuser assembly on a
				laser printer). Consequently, nothing painted on the current page is
				actually imaged on the inserted medium. See "Special Media Handling"
				on page 407.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="LeadingEdge">
			<th>LeadingEdge</th>
			<td>integer or null</td>
			<td><i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i> A code specifying the edge of the
				input medium that will enter the printing engine or imager first and
				across which data will be imaged. Values reflect positions relative
				to a canonical page in portrait orientation (width smaller than
				height):
				<dl>
					<dt>
						<i>null</i>
					</dt>
					<dd>No request for media orientation</dd>
					<dt>0</dt>
					<dd>Short edge; top of canonical page</dd>

					<dt>2</dt>
					<dd>Short edge; bottom of canonical page</dd>
					<dt>3</dt>
					<dd>Long edge; left side of canonical page</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>
					When duplex printing is enabled, the canonical page orientation
					refers only to the front (recto) side of the medium; the
					orientation of the back (verso) side depends on the <b>Tumble</b>
					parameter (see Section <a href=3.html>6.2.3, "Page Image
						Placement"</a>) and is independent of the value of <b>LeadingEdge</b>.
				</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="ManualFeed">
			<th>ManualFeed</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>A flag indicating whether the input medium is to be fed
				manually by a human operator (<i>true</i>) or automatically (<i>false</i>).
				A <i>true</i> value asserts that the human operator will manually
				feed media conforming to the specified attributes (<b>PageSize</b>,
				<b>MediaColor</b>, <b>MediaWeight</b>, <b>MediaType</b>, <b>MediaClass</b>,
				and <b>InsertSheet</b>). Thus, those attributes are not used to
				select from available media sources in the normal way, although
				their values may be presented to the human operator as an aid in
				selecting the correct medium. On devices that offer more than one
				manual feeding mechanism, the attributes may select among them.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="TraySwitch">
			<th>TraySwitch</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td><i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i> A flag specifying whether the
				output device supports automatic switching of media sources. When
				the originally selected source runs out of medium, some devices with
				multiple media sources can switch automatically, without human
				intervention, to an alternate source with the same attributes (such
				as <b>PageSize</b> and <b>MediaColor</b>) as the original. The
				choice of such an alternate media source is device-specific, and may
				or may not be influenced by the <b>Priority</b> array specified in
				the <b>InputAttributes</b> dictionary (see "Matching Requests with
				Attributes," below).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="MediaPosition">
			<th>MediaPosition</th>
			<td>integer or null</td>
			<td><i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i> The position number of the media
				source to be used. This parameter does not override the normal media
				selection process described in the text, but if specified it will be
				honored&mdash;provided it can satisfy the input media request in a
				manner consistent with normal media selection&mdash;even if the
				media source it specifies is not the best available match for the
				requested attributes.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="DeferredMediaSelection">
			<th>DeferredMediaSelection</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td><i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i> A flag determining when to perform
				media selection. If <i>true</i>, media will be selected by an
				independent printing subsystem associated with the output device
				itself, at some time after the execution of the <a
				href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> operator
				(see "Deferred Media Selection" on page 411). If <i>false</i>, media
				selection is to be done in the normal way, as described below.</td>
