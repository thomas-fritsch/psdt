	<h3>6.2.3 Page Image Placement</h3>
	<p>The page device parameters shown in Table 6.4 control the
		placement of page images on the physical medium. This includes such
		things as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The size and location of the image's outer boundary</li>
		<li>The size of the margins, if any</li>
		<li>Whether and how far to shift right-hand and left-hand pages
			to allow extra space for binding or stapling</li>
		<li>Whether to reflect the page image, either horizontally or
			vertically, for photographic reproduction</li>
		<li>Whether to generate photographic negatives</li>
		<li>Whether to print on one side (simplex) or both sides (duplex)
			of the medium</li>
	</ul>

			<th>Key</th>

		</tr>
		<tr id="HWResolution">
			<th>HWResolution</th>
			<td>array</td>
			<td>An array of two numbers, [x y], specifying the resolution of
				the physical device in pixels per inch along the horizontal and
				vertical dimensions of device space. Most devices support only a
				single resolution or certain specific resolutions, not arbitrary
				ones. The <b>HWResolution</b> entry in the output device dictionary
				(see Section 6.4, "Output Device Dictionary") defines the allowable
				values for this parameter on a given device; attempting to set it to
				an unsupported value will cause a configuration error.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="ImagingBBox">
			<th>ImagingBBox</th>
			<td>array or null</td>
			<td>An optional bounding box defining an outer boundary for each
				page image. If not null, the value is an array of four numbers in
				the default user coordinate system giving the left, bottom, right,
				and top coordinates, respectively, of the bounding box. By
				specifying a page bounding box, a PostScript program asserts that it
				will not paint any marks outside the box. Marks that do fall outside
				the bounding box may or may not be rendered on the output medium. <b>ImagingBBox</b>
				does not necessarily produce the same effect as the <b>clip</b>
				operator, and it should not be used in place of that operator for
				clipping page content.
				<p>
					The page bounding box should lie entirely within the overall page
					boundaries defined by the <b>PageSize</b> parameter (see Table 6.2
					on page 400). A value of null denotes the largest bounding box that
					is possible for the given value of <b>PageSize</b>. (This may not
					encompass the entire sheet of physical medium, however, since many
					devices are incapable of placing marks close to the edges of the
					medium.) If a program specifies <b>PageSize</b> but not <b>ImagingBBox</b>,
					it should explicitly set <b>ImagingBBox</b> to null to prevent it
					from inheriting an inappropriate value from the previous device
					state.
				</p>
				<p>
					Applications should provide a page bounding box whenever possible,
					since it can improve performance by freeing raster memory for other
					purposes. For example, if an application knows that all pages will
					carry an unpainted border, it should indicate this by excluding the
					unpainted area from <b>ImagingBBox</b>.

		<tr id="ImageShift">
			<th>ImageShift</th>
			<td>array</td>
			<td><i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i> An array of two numbers, [x y],
				indicating the distance, in default user space units, that each page
				image is to be shifted horizontally (x) and vertically (y) with
				respect to the physical medium. For page images appearing on the
				front (recto) side of the medium, the horizontal shift is to the
				right if x &gt; 0 and to the left if x &lt; 0; the vertical shift is
				upward if y &gt; 0 and downward if y &lt; 0. For page images
				appearing on the back (verso) side, these directions are reversed.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="PageOffset">
			<th>PageOffset</th>
			<td>array</td>
			<td><i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i> An array of two numbers, [x y],
				that reposition the page image on the physical medium by x units
				horizontally and y units vertically, in the direction of increasing
				coordinate values in the device coordinate system. x and y are
				expressed in units of the default user space (72nds of an inch).
				This parameter is typically used on imagesetters to control the
				placement of the page image on the medium. It differs from <b>Margins</b>
				(below) in that the repositioning is typically accomplished by
				altering the current transformation matrix, although on some devices
				it may instead be accomplished by device-dependent means that are
				independent of the graphics state (in particular, of the CTM).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="Margins">
			<th>Margins</th>
			<td>array</td>
			<td>An array of two numbers, [x y], that reposition the page
				image on the physical medium by x units horizontally and y units
				vertically, in the direction of increasing coordinate values in the
				device coordinate system. x and y are expressed in device-specific
				units, usually units of device space at one of the supported
				resolutions. The purpose of this parameter is to compensate for
				mechanical misalignments in the device, not to perform purposeful
				positioning of the page image itself. It differs from <b>PageOffset</b>
				(above) in that the repositioning is typically accomplished by
				device-dependent means that are independent of the graphics state
				(in particular, of the current transformation matrix). The range and
				precision of the parameter values may be restricted by the physical
				implementation.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="MirrorPrint">
			<th>MirrorPrint</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>A flag specifying whether the page image should be reflected
				along one of the axes of device space. The reflection is typically
				accomplished by devicedependent means that are independent of the
				graphics state (in particular, of the current transformation
				matrix). This feature is supported only by certain devices, such as
				imagesetters, that produce output intended for further photographic
				processing. For example, when output is produced on transparent
				film, <b>MirrorPrint</b> controls whether the page image should be
				viewed with the film emulsion face up or face down.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="NegativePrint">
			<th>NegativePrint</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>A flag specifying, if true, that the page image should be
				produced in colorinverted (negative) form. The inversion is
				typically accomplished by devicedependent means that are independent
				of the graphics state (in particular, of the transfer functions).
				The entire page is inverted, perhaps including portions that lie
				outside the imageable area or that are generated independently of
				the PostScript interpreter. This feature is supported only by
				certain devices, such as imagesetters, that produce output intended
				for further photographic processing.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="Duplex">
			<th>Duplex</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>A flag determining whether the output is to be printed
				duplex (on both sides of the physical medium) or simplex (on one
				side of the medium only). If this flag is true, pairs of consecutive
				page images will be printed on opposite sides of a single sheet of
				medium; if false, each page will be printed on a separate sheet.
				<p>On device activation, a duplex device always prints the first
					page on a new sheet of medium; on deactivation, it automatically
					delivers the last sheet of medium if it has been printed on only
					one side.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="Tumble">
			<th>Tumble</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>A flag specifying the relative orientation of page images on
				opposite sides of a sheet of medium in duplex output (that is, when
				<b>Duplex</b> is true). If <b>Tumble</b> is false, the default user
				spaces of the two pages are oriented suitably for binding at the
				left or right, with vertical (y) coordinates in the two spaces
				increasing toward the same edge of the physical medium. If <b>Tumble</b>
				is true, the default user spaces are oriented suitably for binding
				at the top or bottom, with vertical coordinates increasing toward
				opposite edges of the medium. If <b>Duplex</b> is false, the <b>Tumble</b>
				parameter has no effect.
				<p>
					Note that <b>Tumble</b> is defined in terms of default user
					space&mdash;the user space established by <a
						href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>. The
					orientation of default user space with respect to the medium is
					determined by the <b>PageSize</b> and <b>Orientation</b>
					parameters, possibly altered by the <b>Install</b> procedure.
					Consistent results are obtained across all devices that support
					duplexing, regardless of how the medium moves through the printing
					mechanism. However, if a page description alters user space by
					invoking operators such as <a href="../../8/2/r/rotate.html">rotate</a>,
					the visual orientation of the material printed on the page may
					differ from the orientation of default user space.
