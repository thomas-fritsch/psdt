			roll-fed media</caption>
		<tr>
			<th>Key</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="RollFedMedia">RollFedMedia</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>(LanguageLevel 3) A flag specifying whether the
				medium is roll-fed. The value of this flag may affect the matching
				criteria used for the <b>PageSize</b> page device parameter (see the
				description of <b>PageSize</b> in Table 6.4 on page 414).
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="Orientation">Orientation</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td>A code specifying the orientation of the page
				image on the medium. (The <b>PageSize</b> page device parameter may
				not determine this orientation unambiguously, since pages on a
				roll-fed medium have no inherent orientation.)
				<ol start="0">
					<li>Use normal default orientation as specified by <b>PageSize</b>.
					</li>
					<li>Rotate the image on the medium 90 degrees counterclockwise
						with respect to the default orientation.</li>
					<li>Rotate the image 180 degrees with respect to the default
						orientation.</li>
					<li>Rotate the image 270 degrees counterclockwise (equivalent
						to 90 degrees clockwise) with respect to the default orientation.</li>
				</ol>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="AdvanceMedia">AdvanceMedia</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td>A code indicating whether and when to advance
				the medium by an extra amount (specified by AdvanceDistance) in
				addition to the space occupied by the page images themselves:
				<ol start="0">
					<li>Do not advance the medium.</li>
					<li>Advance the medium at device deactivation.</li>
					<li>Advance the medium at the end of the job. Advancing
						between jobs is controlled by the value of <b>AdvanceMedia</b> for
						the page device that is current between jobs. Thus, this feature
						can be turned on or off only by executing <b>setpagedevice</b> as
						part of an unencapsulated job.
					</li>
					<li>Advance the medium after each page set, as defined by the
						<b>Collate</b> parameter (see Section 6.2.4, "Page Delivery").
					</li>
					<li>Advance the medium after each <b>showpage</b> or <b>copypage</b>
						operation.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="AdvanceDistance">AdvanceDistance</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td>The extra distance, in units of the default
				user space (72nds of an inch), by which to advance the medium as
				indicated by <b>AdvanceMedia</b>.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th id="CutMedia">CutMedia</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td>A code indicating when to cut the medium:
				<ol start="0">
					<li>Do not cut the medium.</li>
					<li>Cut the medium at device deactivation.</li>
					<li>Cut the medium at the end of the job. Cutting between jobs
						is controlled by the value of <b>CutMedia</b> for the page device
						that is current between jobs. Thus, this feature can be turned on
						or off only by executing <b>setpagedevice</b> as part of an
						unencapsulated job.
					</li>
					<li>Cut the medium after each page set, as defined by the <b>Collate</b>
						parameter (see Section 6.2.4, "Page Delivery").

						operation.
