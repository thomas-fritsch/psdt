			<th id="PolicyNotFound">PolicyNotFound</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td>A code specifying the recovery policy to use when a
				requested setting for a page device parameter cannot be satisfied
				and no specific entry for that parameter is present in the <b>Policies</b>
				dictionary:
				<ol start="0">
					<li>Generate a PostScript <a
						href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>&mdash;that
						is, do not attempt recovery, but simply abandon the execution of <a
						href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>, leaving
						the current values of all page device parameters undisturbed.
						Before generating the error, <a
						href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> inserts an
						<b>errorinfo</b> entry into the <a
						href="../../8/2/@/dollar-error.html">$error</a> dictionary. Error
						handling in general and <b>errorinfo</b> in particular are
						discussed in Section <a href="../../3/11.html">3.11, "Errors."</a>
					</li>
					<li>Ignore the request and do not consider this parameter in
						media selection. This is the usual default policy in most
						products. Subsequent calls to <a
						href="../../8/2/c/currentpagedevice.html">currentpagedevice</a>
						will return a dictionary in which the entry for this parameter is
						modified as follows:
						<ul>
							<li>Replaced by null if it is a media selection request</li>
							<li>Unchanged from its former value if the parameter (other
								than a media selection request) is known to the device</li>
							<li>Absent if the parameter is unknown to the device</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Interact with a human operator or print management
						software to determine what to do. The precise effects of this
						policy vary among different output devices and environments. Some
						devices may issue a message (on a front panel, for instance)
						indicating an operator action that is required, then wait for
						confirmation. Other devices have no ability to interact with an
						operator and may generate a <a
						href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>
						in this case.
					</li>

			<th id="PageSize">PageSize</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td>A code specifying the recovery policy to use when a
				requested value for the <b>PageSize</b> parameter cannot be matched
				(within a tolerance of ±5 units) by any available medium:
				<ol start="0">
					<li>Generate a <a href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>,
						as described above for <b>PolicyNotFound</b>. This is the usual
						default policy on most devices.
					</li>
					<li>Do not consider the <b>PageSize</b> parameter in media
						selection. Subsequent calls to <a
						href="../../8/2/c/currentpagedevice.html">currentpagedevice</a>
						will return a dictionary whose <b>PageSize</b> entry describes the
						medium that was actually selected.
					</li>
					<li>Interact with a human operator or print management
						software, as described above for <b>PolicyNotFound</b>.
					</li>
					<li>Select the nearest available medium and adjust the page to
						fit, as described below under "Recovery Policies and Media
						Selection."</li>
					<li>Select the next larger available medium and adjust the
						page to fit.</li>
					<li>Select the nearest available medium but do not adjust the
						page.</li>
					<li>Select the next larger available medium but do not adjust
						the page.</li>
					<li><i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i> If the requested page size is
						within ±5 units of any page size supported by the device, disable
						media selection altogether and impose the requested page size on
						the previously selected medium without adjustment; otherwise,
						generate a <a href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>.
						In the former case, the page device is set up as if the selected
						medium were of the requested size, ignoring the actual size of the
						medium. Positioning of the page image on the medium is
						device-dependent and unpredictable.
						<p>
							This policy exists solely for use in the emulations of certain
							LanguageLevel 1 compatibility operators that perform media
							selection and page device setup separately. Unlike all other
							policies (which take effect only if a request cannot be
							satisfied), this policy takes effect during every execution of
							the <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
							operator. Because its behavior violates the PostScript page
							device model, documents that use this policy are not portable;
							for this reason, it should never be used directly in a page
							description.
						</p></li>
				</ol> Note that if <b>DeferredMediaSelection</b> is true, policies 3 and
				4 may result in a <a href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>,
				since the needed adjustments to the current transformation matrix
				cannot be deferred; the effect of policy 7 under these circumstances
				is device-dependent.

				encountered and the corresponding recovery actions specified in the
				dictionary; see "PolicyReport Procedure" on page 438 for details.
				The procedure can report the actions that were taken or perform
