	<h3>6.2.7 Unsatisfied Parameter Requests</h3>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
		operator is not always able to satisfy a page description's requests
		for particular settings of the page device parameters. It may be
		unable to do so for either of two reasons:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The device does not support the requested parameter at all;
			the PostScript interpreter has no idea what it means. For example, if
			the page description attempts to set a value for the <b>Duplex</b>
			parameter but that parameter is not defined in the page device
			dictionary, <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
			treats it as a request for an unknown feature&mdash;even if the
			requested value is false.
		<li>The device supports the requested parameter but cannot
			achieve the requested value at the moment&mdash;for example, an
			A4-size page is requested when the A4 paper tray is not currently
			installed.
	</ul>
	<p>
		The interpreter can respond to such an unsatisfied parameter request
		in a variety of ways, such as by ignoring it, raising a PostScript
		error, or displaying a message on the front panel of the device
		requesting intervention by the human operator. The <b>Policies</b>
		page device parameter (Table 6.8) is a dictionary specifying which of
		these actions to take, depending on the particular page device
		parameter involved in the request.
	</p>

			<td>A dictionary specifying recovery policies for responding to
				unsatisfied parameter requests. Entries in this dictionary are keyed
				by the names of individual page device parameters; the corresponding
				value for each parameter is an integer code specifying what action
				to take when a requested setting for that parameter cannot be
				satisfied. The entry for any given parameter is optional; the
				dictionary also includes an overall default policy for parameters
				for which no specific recovery policy is defined.

		For most entries in the <b>Policies</b> dictionary, the key is the
		name of a page device parameter; the corresponding value is an integer
		code specifying the <i>recovery policy</i> for handling unsatisfied
		requests for that parameter. For most parameters, there are three
		policy choices: generate an error (<a
			href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>),
		ignore the request, or interact with a human operator or a software
		print manager. For <b>PageSize</b> requests, there are additional
		policy choices. Table 6.9 describes the entries that can appear in the
		<b>Policies</b> dictionary.

				dictionary:
				<ol start="0">
					<li>Generate a PostScript <a
						href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>&mdash;that
						is, do not attempt recovery, but simply abandon the execution of <a
						href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>, leaving
						the current values of all page device parameters undisturbed.
						Before generating the error, <a
						href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> inserts an
						<b>errorinfo</b> entry into the <a
						href="../../8/2/@/dollar-error.html">$error</a> dictionary. Error
						handling in general and <b>errorinfo</b> in particular are
						discussed in Section <a href="../../3/11.html">3.11, "Errors."</a>
					</li>
					<li>Ignore the request and do not consider this parameter in
						media selection. This is the usual default policy in most
						products. Subsequent calls to <a
						href="../../8/2/c/currentpagedevice.html">currentpagedevice</a>
						will return a dictionary in which the entry for this parameter is
						modified as follows:
						<ul>
							<li>Replaced by null if it is a media selection request</li>
							<li>Unchanged from its former value if the parameter (other
								than a media selection request) is known to the device</li>
							<li>Absent if the parameter is unknown to the device</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Interact with a human operator or print management
						software to determine what to do. The precise effects of this
						policy vary among different output devices and environments. Some
						devices may issue a message (on a front panel, for instance)
						indicating an operator action that is required, then wait for
						confirmation. Other devices have no ability to interact with an
						operator and may generate a <a
						href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>
						in this case.

						as described above for <b>PolicyNotFound</b>. This is the usual

						media selection altogether and impose the requested page size on
						the previously selected medium without adjustment; otherwise,
						generate a <a href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>.
						In the former case, the page device is set up as if the selected
						medium were of the requested size, ignoring the actual size of the
						medium. Positioning of the page image on the medium is
						device-dependent and unpredictable.
						<p>
							This policy exists solely for use in the emulations of certain
							LanguageLevel 1 compatibility operators that perform media
							selection and page device setup separately. Unlike all other
							policies (which take effect only if a request cannot be
							satisfied), this policy takes effect during every execution of
							the <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
							operator. Because its behavior violates the PostScript page
							device model, documents that use this policy are not portable;
							for this reason, it should never be used directly in a page
							description.

				</ol> Note that if <b>DeferredMediaSelection</b> is true, policies 3 and
				4 may result in a <a href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>,
				since the needed adjustments to the current transformation matrix
				cannot be deferred; the effect of policy 7 under these circumstances
				is device-dependent.

		Because the <b>Policies</b> dictionary is itself a page device
		parameter, it can be altered with <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> like any
		other such parameter. Ordinarily, a page description composed by an
		application program should not do this; recovery policies should be
		changed only by a human operator or by system management software in
		control of the physical device. However, if a user requests special
		policies when submitting a print job, it is appropriate for the print
		management software to insert a <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> command to
		change the contents of the <b>Policies</b> dictionary at the beginning
		of the page description. For example, the user might consider it
		essential that a particular job use certain features; if they are not
		available, the job should be rejected with a <a
			href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>
		instead of being executed with the requests for those features
		ignored.
	</p>
	<p>
		Changes to the contents of the <b>Policies</b> dictionary are
		cumulative. The <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
		operator merges the entries in the request dictionary supplied to it
		with those in the existing page device dictionary, replacing or adding
		page device entries as appropriate. If a single invocation of <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> includes
		changes to <b>Policies</b> as well as requests for other parameters,
		the merging of <b>Policies</b> entries occurs before the processing of
		the other parameters. Thus, the <i>revised</i> <b>Policies</b>
		dictionary governs the recovery policy if one of the other parameter
		requests cannot be satisfied. For example, the code
	</p>
	<pre>&lt;&lt;     /Duplex true
       /Policies &lt;&lt; /Duplex 0 &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; setpagedevice</pre>
	<p>
		requests duplex printing and generates a <a
			href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a> if
		the device does not support this feature.
