	<h3>6.1.2 Details Dictionaries</h3>
	<p>
		The operation of some page device features depends on the values of
		variables (which may be quite different for different devices) that
		determine precisely how the feature functions. Features of this type
		are generally controlled by two separate page device parameters: a
		boolean parameter that enables or disables the feature as a whole and
		a <i>details dictionary</i> containing the variables that determine
		its precise behavior. This allows an application that is not
		knowledgeable about the feature to use it in a straightforward way,
		while more sophisticated applications can exercise greater control
		over the details of its operation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Details dictionaries follow a consistent naming convention: the name
		of the dictionary is taken from the name of the page device parameter
		that enables or disables it, with the word <b>Details</b> appended.
		For example, the feature enabled by the <b>Trapping</b> parameter is
		controlled by a details dictionary named <b>TrappingDetails</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since the details of a particular feature may not be the same on all
		devices, every details dictionary must contain a <b>Type</b> entry
		indicating the overall composition of the dictionary. The value of
		this entry is an integer that determines how the dictionary's entries
		are organized and interpreted (as well as whether changes to its
		contents are cumulative, as discussed in Section <a href="1.html">6.1.1,
			"Page Device Dictionary"</a>). When a request dictionary passed to <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> includes a
		details dictionary as the value of one of its entries, a configuration
		error will occur if the device does not support the <b>Type</b> value
		specified in the details dictionary.
