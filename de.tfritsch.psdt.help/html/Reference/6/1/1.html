	<h3>6.1.1 Page Device Dictionary</h3>
	<p>
		The current internal state of a page device is modeled by a <i>page
			device dictionary</i> containing entries called <i>page device
			parameters</i>. The keys in this dictionary represent device features or
		processing options; the associated values represent the current
		settings of those features or options. The page device dictionary is
		not directly accessible to a PostScript program, but its contents can
		be read and altered by the <a
			href="../../8/2/c/currentpagedevice.html">currentpagedevice</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> operators.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
			is a page-oriented operator used to control the output processing of
			one or more pages of a page description. Any call to <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> implicitly
			invokes <a href="../../8/2/e/erasepage.html">erasepage</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/i/initgraphics.html">initgraphics</a>, and thus must
			precede the descriptions of the pages to be affected. If the current
			device is not a page device, the effect of invoking <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> is
			device-dependent.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		The operand to <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
		is a <i>request dictionary</i> whose entries specify desired settings
		or values for one or more page device parameters. The request
		dictionary is simply a container that can hold multiple parameter
		requests to be issued in a single call to <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>. The
		interpreter uses the contents of the request dictionary to alter the
		state of the page device parameters, but it does not retain the
		request dictionary itself. Note that the entries in the request
		dictionary are merely requests for certain parameter settings;
		depending on the capabilities of a given page device, these requests
		may or may not be honored. The <a
			href="../../8/2/c/currentpagedevice.html">currentpagedevice</a>
		operator returns a dictionary whose entries reflect the actual current
		settings of the page device parameters, not necessarily those that
		have been requested via <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
		merges new parameter settings into the existing state of the device,
		its effects are cumulative over multiple executions. That is, the
		effect of setting a particular page device parameter persists through
		subsequent invocations of <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
		until explicitly overridden or until the device is restored to some
		previous state by a <a href="../../8/2/r/restore.html">restore</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/g/grestore.html">grestore</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/g/grestoreall.html">grestoreall</a>, or <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setgstate.html">setgstate</a> operation. This
		cumulative behavior also applies recursively (to one level) to the
		contents of subsidiary dictionaries that are the values of the page
		device parameters <b>Policies</b>, <b>InputAttributes</b>, and <b>OutputAttributes</b>
		(all of which are described in detail later in this chapter). It does
		not apply to the contents of other entries whose values happen to be
		dictionaries (except possibly to the contents of details dictionaries
		passed to <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>;
		see Section 6.1.2, "Details Dictionaries").
	</p>
	<p>
		Because the effects of <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
		are cumulative, a PostScript program can make multiple calls to <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>, each
		requesting particular parameter settings but leaving the settings of
		other parameters undisturbed. This allows different features or
		options to be specified independently. In particular:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When an application generates a page description, it can
			include a call to <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
			specifying parameters that reflect assumptions the application has
			made in formatting the document, such as the page size and bounding
			box.
		</li>
		<li>When a user requests printing, an additional call to <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> can be
			prepended to the page description to specify print-time options such
			as twosided printing or the number of copies.
		</li>

		<li>The person operating the device can invoke <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>, as part of
			an unencapsulated job, to specify the available media, establish
			recovery policies for dealing with unsatisfied requests, and
			establish default values for other device options. (Jobs and
			encapsulation are discussed in Section <a href="../../3/7/7.html">3.7.7,
				"Job Execution Environment."</a>)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For certain parameters, there is a null value that indicates the
		absence of any specific request or preference. In all cases, the null
		object (that is, the value of <b>null</b> in <a
			href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>) is used for this
		purpose. For example, a null value for the <b>MediaColor</b> parameter
		indicates that no specific paper color has been requested. Null values
		are permitted only for certain features, as indicated in the relevant
		table entries in Section <a href="../2.html">6.2, "Page Device
			Parameters."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Omitting a parameter key from the request dictionary has a different
		meaning than including the key with a null value. Omitting the key
		leaves the parameter's previous value unchanged; specifying a null
		value sets it to the null object, canceling any previous value it may
		have had. The dictionary returned by <a
			href="../../8/2/c/currentpagedevice.html">currentpagedevice</a>
		always contains an entry for every parameter supported by the device,
		though the value for some parameters may be null (indicating that the
		feature is supported but no setting has yet been requested for it).
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The PostScript language does not prescribe a
			default value for any page device parameter. The usual default value
			for optional features is either false or null, but this is not
			invariably the case for all devices. A PostScript program can change
			the default values by invoking <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> as part of an
			unencapsulated job.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		If the request dictionary requests parameter settings that the device
		cannot satisfy (for example, if a program requests duplex printing on
		a device that does not support it), the PostScript interpreter invokes
		a uniform <i>recovery policy</i> for determining what to do. This
		policy may vary depending on the specific page device parameter
		involved. For most parameters, there are three possibilities:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ignore the request (for example, print simplex on a device
			that cannot honor a request for duplex printing).</li>
		<li>Generate a <a href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>
			(reject the job).
		</li>
		<li>Notify the human operator or the print management software to
			determine what to do.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The choice is based on information in the Policies subdictionary of
		the page device dictionary, which in turn can be altered by <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>; see Section
		<a href="../2/7.html">6.2.7, "Unsatisfied Parameter Requests,"</a> for
		further details.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> In the descriptions of individual page device
			parameters in this chapter, the statement “a configuration error will
			occur” actually means that the PostScript interpreter will take one
			of the three possible actions listed above, according to specified
			policy. Thus a "configuration error" is not necessarily the same
			thing as a PostScript <a href="../../8/2/c/configurationerror.html">configurationerror</a>.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		If a device does not support a particular feature, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> will not
		recognize any request to specify a value for the corresponding
		parameter. For example, if a device does not have a duplexing
		mechanism, <a href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>
		will not recognize the parameter key <b>Duplex</b>&mdash;even if the
		request is to set the value of <b>Duplex</b> to <i>false</i>,
		indicating no duplexing. Instead, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> will consult
		policy to determine what to do. (Note that this means a print job
		cannot expand the set of keys in a device's page device dictionary,
		though it can add new keys to the Policies dictionary.) This behavior
		may seem surprising, but it is necessitated by the fact that the set
		of device features is open-ended.
