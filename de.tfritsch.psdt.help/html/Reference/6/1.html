	<h2>6.1 Using Page Devices</h2>
	<p>Many output devices have special hardware features, such as
		multiple paper trays with different sizes of paper, duplex (two-sided)
		printing, collation, finishing options, and so forth. Not all such
		features are available on all devices, however. The PostScript
		interpreter knows what features a device supports and which are
		currently available and ready for use.</p>
	<p>
		A document's device configuration requirements may limit the set of
		devices on which the document can be printed. Specifying such
		configuration information within a PostScript page description allows
		the interpreter to match the document's requirements with the features
		and options available on a given output device. The <a
			href="../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> operator
		provides a uniform framework for specifying configuration requirements
		and options. It uses a standard format to request features supported
		by all devices (such as selecting a page size) and those supported
		only by some devices (such as duplex printing). In addition, <a
			href="../8/2/s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a> allows a user or
		system administrator to establish default device configuration
		parameters to be used when a page description does not specify them
		explicitly. It also provides a standard mechanism for determining what
		to do when a page description makes feature requests that the device
		cannot fulfill.
	</p>
	<p>It is useful, at least in concept, to envision two separate
		tasks when printing from an application:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Generate a device-independent page description.</li>
		<li>Request that the page description be rendered on a particular
			device. At this point, the user should have an opportunity to add
			processing options, including device-dependent ones, to the page
			description.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Even if a single application performs both of these functions,
		it is best to maintain the distinction. Many applications have an
		option to store the generated page description in a file for later
		use. Such a file should not contain unnecessary device-dependent
		processing options. The distinction between document generation and
		document rendering is essential when using PostScript programs for
		document storage and interchange.</p>
	<p>While there is no clear division between device-independent
		processing requests and device-dependent ones, you should keep in mind
		the important goal of producing device-independent page descriptions.
		One important criterion to apply is whether a particular feature is
		inherently part of the document specification itself or merely a
		processing option. For example, the page size&mdash;in particular, the
		aspect ratio between width and height&mdash;is an important part of
		the document specification, because the application generating the
		document must make formatting decisions based on it. On the other
		hand, the number of copies to be printed or the color of the paper to
		be used is not an inherent part of the document description, but
		rather a processing option.</p>
