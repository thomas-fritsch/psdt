	<h3>copypage</h3>
	<pre>- <b>copypage</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		transmits the contents of the current page to the current output
		device, but without performing the additional reinitialization actions
		that <a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a> performs. Specifically,
		its behavior differs from that of <a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a>
		in the following ways:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a> usually performs
			the equivalent of an <a href="../e/erasepage.html">erasepage</a>
			operation after transmitting the page, clearing the contents of
			raster memory in preparation for the next page. <b>copypage</b>
			performs this step only in LanguageLevel 3; in LanguageLevels 1 and
			2, it does not erase the page after transmission.</li>
		<li><a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a> then always
			performs the equivalent of an <a href="../i/initgraphics.html">initgraphics</a>
			operation, reinitializing the graphics state for the next page. <b>copypage</b>
			never does this.</li>
		<li>If an EndPage procedure is defined in the page device
			dictionary, <a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a> passes it a
			reason code of 0 on the operand stack, indicating that it is being
			called from <a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a>. In
			LanguageLevels 1 and 2, <b>copypage</b> passes a reason code of 1 to
			inform the <b>EndPage</b> procedure that it is being called from <b>copypage</b>
			rather than <a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a>; in
			LanguageLevel 3, <b>copypage</b> passes a reason code of 0, as if the
			call were coming from <a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a>
			instead. See Section <a href="../../../6/2/6.html">6.2.6, "Device
				Initialization and Page Setup,"</a> for more information on <b>EndPage</b>
			procedures and reason codes.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If a device's <b>BeginPage</b> or <b>EndPage</b> procedure invokes <b>copypage</b>,
		an <a href="../u/undefined.html">undefined</a> error occurs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that because <b>copypage</b> behaves differently in LanguageLevel
		3 than in LanguageLevels 1 and 2, some uses of this operator will
		produce different results depending on LanguageLevel. For example,
		some old applications used the code
	</p>
	<pre>  n {copypage} repeat
  erasepage</pre>
	<p>
		to produce <i>n</i> copies of the current page; in LanguageLevel 3,
		this will instead produce one copy followed by <i>n</i> - 1 blank
		pages. Similarly, applications that used <b>copypage</b> to implement
		forms in LanguageLevels 1 and 2 can no longer do so in LanguageLevel
		3; the first page will be printed correctly, showing both fixed and
		variable contents, but subsequent pages will show only the variable
		contents, the fixed contents having been erased.
	</p>
	<p>
		The use of this operator is discouraged. It is intended primarily as a
		debugging aid. Routine use of <b>copypage</b> as a substitute for <a
			href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a> may <i>severely</i> degrade
		the page throughput of some PostScript devices. To print multiple
		copies of the same page, use the <b>#copies</b> implicit parameter of
		<a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a> or the NumCopies parameter
		of <a href="../s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>.
