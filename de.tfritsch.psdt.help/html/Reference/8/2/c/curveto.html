	<p>
		adds a Bezier cubic section to the current path between the current
		point, referred to here as (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>), and the
		point (x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>), using (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)
		and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) as the Bezier cubic control points.
		After constructing the curve, curveto makes (x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>)
		the new current point. If the current point is undefined because the
		current path is empty, curveto executes the error <a
			href="../n/nocurrentpoint.html">nocurrentpoint</a>.

		The four points define the shape of the curve geometrically. The curve
		starts at (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>), it is tangent to the line
		from (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) to (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)
		at that point, and it leaves the point in that direction. The curve
		ends at (x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>), it is tangent to the line from
		(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) to (x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>) at
		that point, and it approaches the point from that direction. The
		lengths of the lines (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) to (x<sub>1</sub>,
		y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) to (x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>)
		represent, in a sense, the &quot;velocity&quot; of the path at the
		endpoints. The curve is always entirely enclosed by the convex
		quadrilateral defined by the four points.

	<p>The mathematical formulation of a Bezier cubic curve is derived
		from a pair of parametric cubic equations:</p>
	<p>The cubic section produced by curveto is the path traced by x(t)
		and y(t) as t ranges from 0 to 1. The Bezier control points
		corresponding to this curve are:</p>
