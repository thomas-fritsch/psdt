	<h3>currentpoint</h3>
	<pre>- <b>currentpoint</b> x y</pre>
	<p>
		returns the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates, in the user coordinate
		system, of the current point in the graphics state (the trailing
		endpoint of the current path).
	</p>
	<p>
		As discussed in Section <a href="../../../4/4/1.html">4.4.1,
			"Current Path,"</a> points entered into a path are immediately converted
		to device coordinates by the current transformation matrix (CTM);
		subsequent modifications to the CTM do not affect existing points. <b>currentpoint</b>
		computes the user space coordinates corresponding to the current point
		according to the current value of the CTM. Thus, if a current point is
		set and then the CTM is changed, the coordinates returned by <b>currentpoint</b>
		will be different from those that were originally specified for the
		point.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the current point is undefined because the current path is empty, a
		<a href="../n/nocurrentpoint.html">nocurrentpoint</a> error occurs.
