	<b>currentpoint</b>
	<pre>- <b>currentpoint</b> x y</pre>
	<p>
		returns the x and y coordinates of the current point in the graphics
		state (i.e., the trailing endpoint of the current path). If the
		current point is undefined because the current path is empty,
		currentpoint executes the <a href="../n/nocurrentpoint.html">nocurrentpoint</a>
		error. The current point is reported in the user coordinate system.
		Points entered into a path are immediately converted to device
		coordinates by the current transformation matrix (CTM); existing
		points are not changed by subsequent modifications to the CTM.
		currentpoint computes the user space coordinate that corresponds to
		the current point according to the current value of the CTM. If a
		current point is set and then the CTM is changed, currentpoint will
		report a different position in user space than it did before.
