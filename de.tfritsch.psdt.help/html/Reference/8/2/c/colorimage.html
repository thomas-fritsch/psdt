	<pre>width height bits/comp matrix datasrc<sub>0</sub> ... datasrc<sub>n-1</sub> multi ncomp <b>colorimage</b> -</pre>
	<p>paints a sampled image onto the current page. The description
		here only summarizes the colorimage operator.</p>
	<p>
		The sampled image is a rectangular array of width x height sample
		values. colorimage interprets the width, height, and matrix operands
		in the same way as does <a href="../i/image.html">image</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Each image sample consists of 1, 3, or 4 color components, as
		specified by the ncomp operand. Each component consists of bits/comp
		bits (1, 2, 4, 8, or 12). All components are the same size.</p>
	<p>If ncomp is 1, the samples have only one (gray) component; the
		operation of colorimage is equivalent to that of image using the first
		five operands. If ncomp is 3, the samples consist of red, green, and
		blue components. If ncomp is 4, the samples consist of cyan, magenta,
		yellow, and black components. The 1, 3, and 4 component values are
		interpreted according to the DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, and DeviceCMYK
		color spaces, respectively, regardless of the current color space.</p>
	<p>
		The multi operand is a boolean that determines how colorimage is to
		obtain sample data from its data sources. If multi is false, there is
		a single data source, datasrc<sub>0</sub>; colorimage obtains all
		components from that source, interleaved on a per-sample basis. If
		multi is true, there are ncomp data sources, datasrc<sub>0</sub> ...
		datasrc<sub>n-1</sub>, one for each component. The data sources can be
		procedures, strings, or files, including filtered files. They must all
		be of the same type.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike <a href="../i/image.html">image</a> and <a
			href="../i/imagemask.html">imagemask</a>, colorimage does not have an
		alternate form in which the parameters are bundled into a single image
		dictionary operand. In Level 2 implementations, given the appropriate
		image dictionary, the image operator can do anything that colorimage
		can do, and many other things. For example, image can interpret color
		samples in any color space, whereas colorimage is limited to the
		DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, and DeviceCMYK color spaces.
	</p>
	<p>Execution of this operator is not permitted in certain
		circumstances.</p>
