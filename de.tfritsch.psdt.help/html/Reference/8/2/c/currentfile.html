	<h3>currentfile</h3>
	<pre>- <b>currentfile</b> file</pre>
	<p>returns the file object from which the PostScript interpreter is
		currently or was most recently reading program input&mdash;that is,
		the topmost file object on the execution stack. The returned file has
		the literal attribute.</p>
	<p>
		If there is no file object on the execution stack, <b>currentfile</b>
		returns an invalid file object that does not correspond to any file.
		This never occurs during execution of ordinary user programs.
	</p>
	<p>
		The file returned by <b>currentfile</b> is usually but not always the
		standard input file. An important exception occurs during interactive
		mode operation (see Section <a href="../../../3/8/3.html">3.8.3,
			"Special Files"</a>). In this case, the interpreter does not read
		directly from the standard input file; instead, it reads from a file
		representing an edited statement (each statement is represented by a
		different file).
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>currentfile</b> operator is useful for obtaining images or
		other data residing in the program file itself (see the example
		below). At any given time, this file is positioned at the end of the
		last PostScript token read from the file by the interpreter. If that
		token was a number or a name immediately followed by a white-space
		character, the file is positioned after the white-space character (the
		first, if there are several); otherwise, it is positioned after the
		last character of the token.
	</p>

		<b>Example</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
/str 100 string def
currentfile str readline
here is a line of text
pop /textline exch def
</pre>
	<p>After execution of this example, the name /textline is
		associated with the string &quot;here is a line of text&quot;.</p>
