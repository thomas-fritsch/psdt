	<h3>currentfile</h3>
	<pre>- <b>currentfile</b> file</pre>
	<p>returns the file object from which the PostScript interpreter is
		currently or was most recently reading program input. Precisely,
		currentfile returns the topmost file object on the execution stack. If
		there isn't one, it returns an invalid file object that doesn't
		correspond to any file. This never occurs during execution of ordinary
		user programs.</p>
	<p>The file returned by currentfile is usually but not always the
		standard input file. An important exception occurs during interactive
		mode operation. In this case, the interpreter does not read directly
		from the standard input file; instead, it reads from a file
		representing an edited statement (each statement is represented by a
		different file).</p>
	<p>The currentfile operator is useful for obtaining images or other
		data residing in the program file itself (see the example below). At
		any given time, this file is positioned at the end of the last
		PostScript language token read from the file by the interpreter. If
		that token was a number or a name immediately followed by a white
		space character, the file is positioned after the white space
		character (the first, if there are several). Otherwise it is
		positioned after the last character of the token.</p>

		<b>Example</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
/str 100 string def
currentfile str readline
here is a line of text
pop /textline exch def
</pre>
	<p>After execution of this example, the name /textline is
		associated with the string &quot;here is a line of text&quot;.</p>
