	<p>intersects the inside of the current clipping path with the
		inside of the current path to produce a new, smaller current clipping
		path. The inside of the current path is determined by the normal
		PostScript non-zero winding number rule, while the inside of the
		current clipping path is determined by whatever rule was used at the
		time that path was created.</p>
	<p>In general, clip produces a new path whose inside (according to
		the non-zero winding number rule) consists of all areas that are
		inside both of the original paths. The way this new path is
		constructed (the order of its segments, whether it self-intersects,
		etc.) is not specified. clip treats an open subpath of the current
		path as though it were closed; it does not actually alter the path
		itself. It is permissible for the current path to be empty. The result
		of executing clip is always a non-empty clipping path, though it may
		enclose zero area.</p>
	<p>
		There is no way to enlarge the current clipping path (other than by <a
			href="../i/initclip.html">initclip</a> or <a
			href="../i/initgraphics.html">initgraphics</a>) or to set a new
		clipping path without reference to the current one. The recommended
		way of using clip is to bracket the clip and the sequence of graphics
		to be clipped with <a href="../g/gsave.html">gsave</a> and <a
			href="../g/grestore.html">grestore</a>. The grestore will restore the
		clipping path that was in effect before the gsave. The <a
			href="../s/setgstate.html">setgstate</a> operator can also be used to
		reset the clipping path to an earlier state.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike <a href="../f/fill.html">fill</a> and <a
			href="../s/stroke.html">stroke</a>, clip does not implicitly perform
		a <a href="../n/newpath.html">newpath</a> after it has finished using
		the current path. Any subsequent path construction operators will
		append to the current path unless newpath is executed explicitly. This
		can cause unexpected behavior.
