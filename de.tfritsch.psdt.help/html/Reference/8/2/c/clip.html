	<pre>- <b>clip</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		intersects the area inside the current clipping path with the area
		inside the current path to produce a new, smaller clipping path. The
		nonzero winding number rule (see <a href="../../../4/5/2.html#1">"Nonzero
			Winding Number Rule"</a> on page 195) is used to determine what points
		lie inside the current path, while the inside of the current clipping
		path is determined by whatever rule was used at the time the path was
		created.
	</p>
	<p>
		In general, <b>clip</b> produces a new path whose inside (according to
		the nonzero winding number rule) consists of all areas that are inside
		both of the original paths. The way this new path is constructed (the
		order of its segments, whether it self-intersects, and so forth) is
		not specified. <b>clip</b> treats an open subpath of the current path
		as though it were closed; it does not actually alter the path itself.
		It is permissible for the current path to be empty. The result of
		executing <b>clip</b> is always a nonempty clipping path, though it
		may enclose zero area.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is no way to enlarge the current clipping path (other than by <a
			href="../i/iitclip.html">initclip</a> or <a
			href="../i/initgraphics.html">initgraphics</a>) or to set a new
		clipping path without reference to the current one. The recommended
		way of using <b>clip</b> is to bracket the <b>clip</b> operation and
		the sequence of graphics operations to be clipped between <a
			href="../g/gsave.html">gsave</a> and <a href="../g/grestore.html">grestore</a>
		or between <a href="../c/clipsave.html">clipsave</a> and <a
			href="../c/cliprestore.html">cliprestore</a>. The <a
			href="../g/grestore.html">grestore</a> will restore the clipping path
		that was in effect before the <a href="../g/gsave.html">gsave</a>. The
		<a href="../s/setgstate.html">setgstate</a> operator can also be used
		to reset the clipping path to an earlier state.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike <a href="../f/fill.html">fill</a> and <a
			href="../s/stroke.html">stroke</a>, <b>clip</b> does not implicitly
		perform a <a href="../n/newpath.html">newpath</a> operation after it
		has finished using the current path. Any subsequent path construction
		operators will append to the current path unless <a
			href="../n/newpath.html">newpath</a> is executed explicitly; this can
		cause unexpected behavior.
