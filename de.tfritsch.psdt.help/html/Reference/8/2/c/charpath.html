	<h3>charpath</h3>
	<pre>string bool <b>charpath</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		obtains the character path outlines that would result if <i>string</i>
		were shown at the current point using <a href="../s/show.html">show</a>.
		Instead of painting the path, however, <b>charpath</b> appends the
		path to the current path. This yields a result suitable for general
		filling, stroking, or clipping (see Section <a
			href="../../../4/4.html">4.4, “Path Construction”</a>; <a
			href="../../../4/5.html">4.5, “Painting”</a>; and <a
			href="../../../5/1.html">5.1, “Organization and Use of Fonts”</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		The <i>bool</i> operand determines what happens if the character path
		is designed to be stroked rather than filled or outlined. If <i>bool</i>
		is <i>false</i>, charpath simply appends the character path to the
		current path; the result is suitable only for stroking. If bool is <i>true</i>,
		<b>charpath</b> applies the <a href="../s/strokepath.html">strokepath</a>
		operator to the character path; the result is suitable for filling or
		clipping, but not for stroking. <b>charpath</b> does not produce
		results for portions of a character defined as images or masks rather
		than as paths.
	</p>
	<p>
		The outlines of some fonts are protected. (In Level 1 implementations,
		this applies to all fonts; in Level 2, only to certain special fonts
		and not to ordinary Type 1 or Type 3 fonts.) If the current font is
		protected, using <b>charpath</b> to obtain its outlines causes the <a
			href="../p/pathforall.html">pathforall</a> and <a
			href="../u/upath.html">upath</a> operators to be disabled for as long
		as those outlines remain in the current path.
