	<h3>charpath</h3>
	<pre>string bool <b>charpath</b> -</pre>
	<p>obtains the character path outlines that would result if string
		were shown at the current point using show. Instead of painting the
		path, however, charpath appends the path to the current path. This
		yields a result suitable for general filling, stroking, or clipping
		false
	<p>
		The bool operand determines what happens if the character path is
		designed to be stroked rather than filled or outlined. If bool is <a
			href="../f/false.html">false</a>, charpath simply appends the
		character path to the current path; the result is suitable only for
		stroking. If bool is <a href="../t/true.html">true</a>, charpath
		applies the strokepath operator to the character path; the result is
		suitable for filling or clipping, but not for stroking. charpath does
		not produce results for portions of a character defined as images or
		masks rather than as paths.
	</p>
	<p>
		The outlines of some fonts are protected. (In Level 1 implementations,
		this applies to all fonts; in Level 2, only to certain special fonts
		and not to ordinary Type 1 or Type 3 fonts.) If the current font is
		protected, using charpath to obtain its outlines causes the <a
			href="../p/pathforall.html">pathforall</a> and <a
			href="../u/upath.html">upath</a> operators to be disabled for as long
		as those outlines remain in the current path.
