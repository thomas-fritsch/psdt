	<h3>currentpagedevice [LEVEL 2]</h3>
	<pre>- <b>currentpagedevice</b> dict</pre>
	<p>
		returns a read-only dictionary that describes the page-oriented output
		device in the current graphics state. currentpagedevice creates a new
		dictionary if necessary. If the device in the current graphics state
		is not a page device, currentpagedevice returns an empty dictionary
		(length of 0). Changes made to the hardware state of the output device
		since the last execution of <a href="../s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>,
		such as changing paper trays or switches, are not immediately
		reflected in this dictionary. If the current context is under the
		control of a job server, the server sets up a device that matches the
		hardware state before starting each job. At the beginning of each job,
		therefore, the dictionary currentpagedevice returns matches the
		current hardware state.
