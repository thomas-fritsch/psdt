	<pre>- <b>currentpagedevice</b> dict</pre>
	<p>
		returns a read-only dictionary reflecting the current contents of the
		page device dictionary in the graphics state (see Section <a
			href="../../../6./1/1.html">6.1.1, "Page Device Dictionary"</a>). If
		the current output device is not a page device, the dictionary
		returned will be empty. <b>currentpagedevice</b> creates a new
		dictionary if necessary. It is unspecified whether parameters that are
		composite objects are copied from or shared with the original
		parameters that were given to <a href="../s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Changes made to the hardware state of the output device since the last
		execution of <a href="../s/setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>, such
		as changing paper trays or switch settings, are not immediately
		reflected in the dictionary returned by <b>currentpagedevice</b>. If
		the execution environment is under the control of a job server (see
		Section <a href="../../../3/7/7.html">3.7.7, "Job Execution
			Environment"</a>), the server sets up a page device dictionary that
		matches the hardware state before starting each job. At the beginning
		of each job, therefore, the dictionary returned by <b>currentpagedevice</b>
		correctly matches the current hardware state of the device.
