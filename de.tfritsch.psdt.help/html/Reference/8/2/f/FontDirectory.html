	<h3>FontDirectory</h3>
	<pre>- <b>FontDirectory</b> dict</pre>
	<p>pushes a dictionary of defined fonts on the operand stack.
		FontDirectory is not an operator; it is a name in systemdict
		associated with the dictionary object.</p>
	<p>The FontDirectory dictionary associates font names with font
		dictionaries. definefont places entries in FontDirectory, and findfont
		looks there first. The dictionary is read-only; only definefont and
		undefinefont can change it.</p>
	<p>
		Although FontDirectory contains all fonts that are currently defined
		in VM, it does not necessarily describe all the fonts available to a
		PostScript language program. This is because the findfont operator can
		sometimes obtain fonts from an external source and load them into VM
		dynamically. Consequently, examining FontDirectory is not a reliable
		method of inquiring about available fonts. The preferred method is to
		use the <a href="../r/resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a> and <a
			href="../r/resourceforall.html">resourceforall</a> operators, which
		are Level 2 features, to inquire about the Font resource category.
	</p>
	<p>In Level 2, when global VM allocation mode is in effect, the
		name FontDirectory is temporarily rebound to the value of
		GlobalFontDirectory, which contains only those fonts that have been
		defined in global VM. This ensures the correct behavior of fonts that
		are defined in terms of other fonts.</p>
