	<b>filenameforall</b> LEVEL 2
	<pre>template proc scratch <b>filenameforall</b> -</pre>
	<p>enumerates all files whose names match the specified template
		string. For each matching file, filenameforall copies the file's name
		into the supplied scratch string, pushes a string object designating
		the substring of scratch actually used, and calls proc. filenameforall
		does not return any results of its own, but proc may do so.</p>
	<p>The details of template matching are device dependent, but the
		following convention is typical. All characters in the template are
		treated literally and are case sensitive, except the following special
		characters:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>*</dt>
		<dd>matches zero or more consecutive characters.</dd>
		<dt>?</dt>
		<dd>matches exactly one character.</dd>
		<dt>\</dt>
		<dd>causes the next character of the template to be treated
			literally, even if it is *, ?, or /.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>If template does not begin with %, it is matched against device
		relative file names of all devices in the search order. When a match
		occurs, the file name passed to proc is likewise device relative-in
		other words, it does not have a %device% prefix.</p>
	<p>If template does begin with %, it is matched against complete
		file names in the form %device%file. Template matching can be
		performed on the device, the file, or both parts of the name. When a
		match occurs, the file name passed to proc is likewise in the complete
		form %device%file.</p>
	<p>The order of enumeration is unspecified and device dependent.
		There are no restrictions on what proc can do. However, if proc causes
		new files to be created, it is unspecified whether or not those files
		will be encountered later in the same enumeration. Likewise, the set
		of file names considered for template matching is device dependent.</p>
