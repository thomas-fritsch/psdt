	<p>
		If <i>file</i> is an output file, <b>flushfile</b> causes any buffered
		characters for that file to be delivered immediately. In general, a
		program requiring output to be sent immediately, such as during
		real-time, two-way interactions, should call <b>flushfile</b> after
		generating that output.
	</p>
	<p>
		If <i>file</i> is an input file, <b>flushfile</b> reads and discards
		data from that file until the end-of-file indication is encountered.
		This is useful during error recovery, and the PostScript job server
		uses it for that purpose. <b>flushfile</b> does not close the file,
		unless it is a decoding filter file.
