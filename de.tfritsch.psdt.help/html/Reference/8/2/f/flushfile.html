	<p>If file is an output file, flushfile causes any buffered
		characters for that file to be delivered immediately. In general, a
		program requiring output to be sent immediately, such as during
		real-time, two-way interactions, should call flushfile after
		generating that output.</p>
	<p>If file is an input file, flushfile reads and discards data from
		file until the end-offile indication is encountered. This is useful
		during error recovery, and the PostScript job server uses it for that
		purpose. flushfile does not close the file, unless it is a decoding
		filter file.</p>
