	<b>for</b>
	<pre>initial increment limit proc <b>for</b> -</pre>
	<p>executes proc repeatedly, passing it a sequence of values from
		initial by steps of increment to limit. The for operator expects
		initial, increment, and limit to be numbers. It maintains a temporary
		internal variable, known as the control variable, which it first sets
		to initial. Then, before each repetition, it compares the control
		variable with the termination value limit. If limit has not been
		exceeded, it pushes the control variable on the operand stack,
		executes proc, and adds increment to the control variable.</p>
	<p>
		The termination condition depends on whether increment is positive or
		negative. If increment is positive, for terminates when the control
		variable becomes greater than limit. If increment is negative, for
		terminates when the control variable becomes less than limit. If
		initial meets the termination condition, for does not execute proc at
		all. If proc executes the <a href="../e/exit.html">exit</a> operator,
		for terminates prematurely.
	</p>
	<p>Usually, proc will use the value on the operand stack for some
		purpose. However, if proc does not remove the value, it will remain
		there. Successive executions of proc will cause successive values of
		the control variable to accumulate on the operand stack.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Examples</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
0 1 1 4 {add} for &rArr; 10
1 2 6 { } for     &rArr; 1 3 5
3 -.5 1 {} for    &rArr; 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0
</pre>
	<p>In the first example, the value of the control variable is added
		to whatever is on the stack, so 1, 2, 3, and 4 are added in turn to a
		running sum whose initial value is 0. The second example has an empty
		procedure, so the successive values of the control variable are left
		on the stack. The last example counts backward from 3 to 1 by halves,
		leaving the successive values on the stack.</p>
	<p>Beware of using reals instead of integers for any of the first
		three operands. Most real numbers are not represented exactly. This
		can cause an error to accumulate in the value of the control variable,
		with possibly surprising results. In particular, if the difference
		between initial and limit is a multiple of increment, as in the third
		line of the example, the control variable may not achieve the limit
		value.</p>
