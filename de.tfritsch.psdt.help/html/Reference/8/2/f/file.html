	<h3>file</h3>
	<pre>filename access <b>file</b> file</pre>
	<p>creates a file object for the file identified by filename,
		accessing it as specified by access. Both operands are strings.
		Conventions for both file names and access specifications depend on
		the operating system environment in which the PostScript interpreter
		is running.</p>
	<p>
		Once created and opened, the file object remains valid until the file
		is closed either explicitly (by executing <a
			href="../c/closefile.html">closefile</a>) or implicitly (by
		encountering end-offile while reading or executing the file). A file
		is also closed by <a href="../r/restore.html">restore</a> if the file
		object was created more recently than the <a href="../s/save.html">save</a>
		snapshot being restored, or is closed by garbage collection if the
		file object is no longer accessible. There is a limit on the number of
		files that can be open simultaneously.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the specified filename is malformed or if the file doesn't exist
		and access does not permit creating a new file, file executes an <a
			href="../u/undefinedfilename.html">undefinedfilename</a> error. If
		access is malformed or the requested access is not permitted by the
		device, an <a href="../i/invalidfileaccess.html">invalidfileaccess</a>
		error occurs. If the number of files opened by the current context
		exceeds an implementation limit, a <a href="../l/limitcheck.html">limitcheck</a>
		error occurs. If an environmentdependent error is detected, an <a
			href="../i/ioerror.html">ioerror</a> occurs.
