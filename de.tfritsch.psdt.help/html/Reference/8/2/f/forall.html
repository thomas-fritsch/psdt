       dict proc <b>forall</b> -
     string proc <b>forall</b> -</pre>
	<p>enumerates the elements of the first operand, executing the
		procedure proc for each element. If the first operand is an array,
		string, or packed array, forall pushes an element on the operand stack
		and executes proc for each element in the array, string, or packed
		array, beginning with the element whose index is 0 and continuing
		sequentially. The objects pushed on the operand stack are the array,
		packed array, or string elements. In the case of a string, these
		elements are integers in the range 0 to 255, not one-character
		strings.</p>
	<p>If the first operand is a dictionary, forall pushes a key and a
		value on the operand stack and executes proc for each key-value pair
		in the dictionary. The order in which forall enumerates the entries in
		the dictionary is arbitrary. New entries put in the dictionary during
		execution of proc may or may not be included in the enumeration.</p>
	<p>
		If the first operand is empty (i.e., has length 0), forall does not
		execute proc at all. If proc executes the <a href="../e/exit.html">exit</a>
		operator, forall terminates prematurely.
	</p>
	<p>Although forall does not leave any results on the operand stack
		when it is finished, the execution of proc may leave arbitrary results
		there. If proc does not remove each enumerated element from the
		operand stack, the elements will accumulate there.</p>
