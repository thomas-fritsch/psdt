	<pre>mark obj<sub>1</sub> ... obj<sub>n</sub> proc <b>fork</b> context</pre>
	<p>creates a new execution context using the same local and global
		VM as the current context. The new context begins execution concurrent
		with continued execution of the current context. Which context
		executes first is unpredictable.</p>
	<p>
		The new context's environment is formed by copying the dictionary and
		graphics state stacks of the current context. The initial operand
		stack consists of <i>obj<ub>1</ub></i> through <i>obj<sub>n</sub></i>,
		pushed in the same order (obj<sub>1</sub> through obj<sub>n</sub> are
		objects of any type other than <a href="../m/mark.html">mark</a>).
		fork consumes all operands down to and including the topmost mark. It
		then pushes an integer that uniquely identifies the new context. The
		forked context inherits its object format from the current context;
		other per-context parameters are initialized to default values.
	</p>
	<p>
		When the new context begins execution, it executes the procedure proc.
		If proc runs to completion and returns, the context ordinarily will
		suspend until some other context executes a join on context. However,
		if the context has been detached, it will terminate immediately (see <a
			href="../j/join.html">join</a> and <a href="../d/detach.html">detach</a>).
	</p>
	<p>If proc executes a stop that causes the execution of proc to end
		prematurely, the context will terminate immediately. proc is
		effectively called as follows:</p>
	<pre>
proc stopped {handleerror quit} if
% ...Wait for join or detach...
quit
</pre>
	<p>In other words, if proc stops due to an error, the context
		invokes the error handler in the usual way to report the error. Then
		it terminates regardless of whether it has been detached.</p>
	<p>
		It is illegal to execute fork if there has been any previous save not
		yet matched by a restore. Attempting to do so will cause an <a
			href="../i/invalidcontext.html">invalidcontext</a> error.
