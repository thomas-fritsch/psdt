	<p>paints the area enclosed by the current path with the current
		color. Any previous contents of that area on the current page are
		obscured, so areas may be erased by filling with color set to white.</p>
	<p>Before painting, fill implicitly closes any open subpaths of the
		current path. The inside of the current path is determined by the
		normal non-zero winding number rule.</p>
	<p>fill implicitly performs a newpath after it has finished filling
		the current path. To preserve the current path across a fill
		operation, use the sequence:</p>
	<p>gsave fill grestore</p>
