	<pre>key category <b>findresource</b> instance</pre>
	<p>
		attempts to obtain a named resource instance in a specified category.
		<i>category</i> is a name object that identifies a resource category,
		such as <b>Font</b> (see Section <a href="../../../3/9/2.html">3.9.2,
			"Resource Categories"</a>). <i>key</i> is a name or string object that
		identifies the resource instance. (Names and strings are
		interchangeable; other types of keys are permitted but are not
		recommended.) If it succeeds, <b>findresource</b> pushes the resource
		instance on the operand stack; this is an object whose type depends on
		the resource category.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>findresource</b> first attempts to obtain a resource instance that
		has previously been defined in VM by <a
			href="../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>. If the current VM
		allocation mode is local, <b>findresource</b> considers local resource
		definitions first, then global definitions (see <a
			href="../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>). However, if the
		current VM allocation mode is global, <b>findresource</b> considers
		only global resource definitions.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the requested resource instance is not currently defined in VM, <b>findresource</b>
		attempts to obtain it from an external source. The way this is done is
		not specified by the PostScript language; it varies among different
		implementations and different resource categories. The effect of this
		action is to create an object in VM and execute <a
			href="../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>. <b>findresource</b>
		then returns the newly created object. If <i>key</i> is not a name or
		a string, <b>findresource</b> will not attempt to obtain an external
		resource.
	</p>
	<p>
		When <b>findresource</b> loads an object into VM, it may use global VM
		even if the current VM allocation mode is local. In other words, it
		may set the VM allocation mode to global (true setglobal) while
		loading the resource instance and executing <a
			href="../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>. The policy for
		whether to use global or local VM resides in the <b>FindResource</b>
		procedure for the specific resource category; see Section <a
			href="../../../3/9/2.html">3.9.2, "Resource Categories."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		During its execution, <b>findresource</b> may remove the definitions
		of resource instances that were previously loaded into VM by <b>findresource</b>.
		The mechanisms and policies for this depend on the category and the
		implementation; reclamation of resources may occur at times other than
		during execution of <b>findresource</b>. However, resource definitions
		that were made by explicit execution of <a
			href="../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a> are never
		disturbed by automatic reclamation.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the specified resource category does not exist, an <a
			href="../u/undefined.html">undefined</a> error occurs. If the
		category exists but there is no instance whose name is <i>key</i>, an
		<a href="../u/undefinedresource.html">undefinedresource</a> error
		occurs.
