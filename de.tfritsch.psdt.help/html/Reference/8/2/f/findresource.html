	<h3>findresource [LEVEL 2]</h3>
	<pre>key category <b>findresource</b> instance</pre>
	<p>attempts to obtain a named resource instance in a specified
		category. category is a name object that identifies a resource
		category, such as Font . key is a name or string object that
		identifies the resource instance. (Names and strings are
		interchangeable; other types of keys are permitted but are not
		recommended.) If it succeeds, findresource pushes the resource
		instance on the operand stack; this is an object whose type depends on
		the resource category.</p>
	<p>
		findresource first attempts to obtain a resource instance that has
		previously been defined in VM by defineresource. If the current VM
		allocation mode is local, findresource considers local resource
		definitions first, then global definitions (see <a
			href="../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>). However, if the
		current VM allocation mode is global, findresource considers only
		global resource definitions.
	</p>
	<p>If the requested resource instance is not currently defined in
		VM, findresource attempts to obtain it from an external source. The
		way this is done is not specified by the PostScript language; it
		varies among different implementations and different resource
		categories. The effect of this action is to create an object in VM and
		execute defineresource. findresource then returns the newly created
		object. If key is not a name or string, findresource will not attempt
		to obtain an external resource.</p>
	<p>When findresource loads an object into VM, it ordinarily
		attempts to use global VM, regardless of the current VM allocation
		mode. In other words, it sets the VM allocation mode to global (true
		setglobal) while loading the resource instance and executing
		defineresource. However, certain resource instances do not function
		correctly when loaded into global VM; findresource uses local VM
		instead. This always occurs for type 3 font definitions and for any
		resource instance whose definition includes an explicit false
		setglobal.</p>
	<p>
		During its execution, findresource may remove the definitions of
		resource instances that were previously loaded into VM by
		findresource. The mechanisms and policies for this depend on the
		category and the implementation; reclamation of resources may occur at
		times other than during execution of findresource. However, resource
		definitions that were made by explicit execution of <a
			href="../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a> are never
		disturbed by automatic reclamation.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the specified resource category does not exist, an <a
			href="../u/undefined.html">undefined</a> error occurs. If the
		category exists but there is no instance whose name is key, an <a
			href="../u/undefinedresource.html">undefinedresource</a> error
		occurs.
