	<pre>- <b>UserObjects</b> array</pre>
	<p>
		returns the current UserObjects array defined in <a
			href="userdict.html">userdict</a>. UserObjects is not an operator; it
		is simply a name associated with an array in userdict. This array is
		created and managed by the operators <a
			href="../d/defineuserobject.html">defineuserobject</a>, <a
			href="undefineuserobject.html">undefineuserobject</a>, and <a
			href="../e/execuserobject.html">execuserobject</a>. It defines a
		mapping from small integers (used as array indices) to arbitrary
		objects (the elements of the <a href="../a/array.html">array</a>).
	</p>
	<p>The UserObjects entry in userdict is present only if
		defineuserobject has been executed at least once by the current
		execution context or a context that shares the same local VM. The
		length of the array depends on the index operands of all previous
		executions of defineuserobject.</p>
	<p>Note that defineuserobject, undefineuserobject, and
		execuserobject operate on the value of UserObjects in userdict,
		without regard to the dictionaries currently on the dictionary stack.
		Defining UserObjects in some other dictionary on the dictionary stack
		changes the value returned by executing the name object UserObjects,
		but does not alter the behavior of the user object operators.</p>
	<p>Although UserObjects is an ordinary array object, it should be
		manipulated only by the user object operators. Improper direct
		alteration of UserObjects can subsequently cause the user object
		operators to malfunction.</p>
