	<b>upath</b> LEVEL 2
	<pre>bool <b>upath</b> userpath</pre>
	<p>creates a new user path object that is equivalent to the current
		path in the graphics state. upath creates a new executable array
		object of the appropriate length and fills it with the operands and
		operators needed to describe the current path. upath produces only an
		ordinary user path array, not an encoded user path. It does not
		disturb the current path in the graphics state.</p>
	<p>The bool operand specifies whether the resulting user path is to
		include ucache as its first element.</p>
	<p>Since the current path's coordinates are maintained in device
		space, upath transforms them to user space using the inverse of the
		CTM while constructing the user path. Applying uappend to the
		resulting user path will reproduce the same current path in the
		graphics state, but only if the same CTM is in effect at that time.</p>
	<p>upath is equivalent to:</p>
	<pre>
[
  exch {/ucache cvx} if
  pathbbox /setbbox cvx
  {/moveto cvx} {/lineto cvx} {/curveto cvx} {/closepath cvx} pathforall
] cvx
</pre>
	<p>
		If charpath was used to construct any portion of the current path from
		a font whose outlines are protected, upath is not allowed. Its
		execution will produce an <a href="../i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a>
		error (see <a href="../c/charpath.html">charpath</a>).
