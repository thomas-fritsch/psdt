	<pre>bool <b>upath</b> userpath</pre>
	<p>
		creates a new user path object equivalent to the current path in the
		graphics state. The current path itself is not disturbed. The result
		is an ordinary user path array, not an encoded user path. The <i>bool</i>
		operand specifies whether the user path should include a <a
			href="ucache.html">ucache</a> operator as its first element.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>upath</b> creates a new executable array object of the appropriate
		length and fills it with the operands and operators needed to describe
		the current path. It is approximately equivalent to the following
		code:
	</p>
	<pre>
[
  exch {/ucache cvx} if
  pathbbox /setbbox cvx
  {/moveto cvx} {/lineto cvx} {/curveto cvx} {/closepath cvx} pathforall
] cvx
</pre>
	<p>
		If the path ends with a <a href="../m/moveto.html">moveto</a>
		operation, <b>upath</b> adjusts the bounding box if necessary to
		enclose it. (Note that <a href="../p/pathbbox.html">pathbbox</a>
		disregards a trailing <a href="../m/moveto.html">moveto</a>
		operation.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Since the current path's coordinates are maintained in device space, <b>upath</b>
		transforms them to user space while constructing the user path, using
		the inverse of the current transformation matrix. Applying <a
			href="uappend.html">uappend</a> to the resulting user path will
		reproduce the original current path only if the same CTM is in effect
		as at the time the path was constructed.
	</p>
	<p>
		If <a href="../c/charpath.html">charpath</a> was used to construct any
		portion of the current path from a font whose outlines are protected,
		<b>upath</b> is not allowed. Its execution will produce an <a
			href="../i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a> error (see <a
			href="../c/charpath.html">charpath</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Errors:</b> <a href="../i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a>, <a
