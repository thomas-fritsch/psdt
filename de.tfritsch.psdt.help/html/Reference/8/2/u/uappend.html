	<pre>userpath <b>uappend</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		interprets a user path definition (see Section <a
			href="../../../4/6.html">4.6, "User Paths"</a>) and appends the
		result to the current path in the graphics state. All operator names
		mentioned in the user path have their standard definitions, unaffected
		by any name redefinitions that may have occurred.
	</p>
	<p>
		If <i>userpath</i> is an ordinary user path (an array or packed array
		whose length is at least 5), <b>uappend</b> is equivalent to the
		following code:
	</p>
	<pre>
systemdict begin     % Ensure standard operator meanings
  cvx exec           % Interpret userpath
end
</pre>
	<p>
		If <i>userpath</i> is an encoded user path, <b>uappend</b> interprets
		it and performs the encoded operations. It does not matter whether the
		user path object is literal or executable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that <b>uappend</b> uses the standard definitions of all operator
		names mentioned in the user path. It does not matter whether the user
		path object is literal or executable.
	</p>
	<p>
		The bounding box specified by the <a href="../s/setbbox.html">setbbox</a>
		operator in the user path applies only to elements of the user path
		itself. It does not apply to other elements of the current path
		constructed either before or after the execution of <b>uappend</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <a href="ucache.html">ucache</a> operation appearing in the user
		path may or may not have an effect, depending on the environment in
		which <b>uappend</b> is executed. If the current path is initially
		empty and no path construction operators are executed after <b>uappend</b>,
		a subsequent painting operator may or may not access the user path
		cache; otherwise, it definitely will not. This is particularly useful
		in the case of <a href="../c/clip.html">clip</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		As part of its execution, <b>uappend</b> temporarily rounds the <i>t<sub>x</sub></i>
		and <i>t<sub>y</sub></i> components of the current transformation
		matrix to the nearest integer values. The reason for this is discussed
		in Section <a href="../../../4/6/4.html">4.6.4, "User Path
			Operators."</a>
