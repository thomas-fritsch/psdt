	<h3>uappend [LEVEL 2]</h3>
	<pre>userpath <b>uappend</b> -</pre>
	<p>interprets a user path definition and appends the result to the
		current path in the graphics state. If userpath is an ordinary user
		path (in other words, an array or packed array whose length is at
		least 5), uappend is equivalent to:</p>
	<pre>
systemdict begin     % Ensure standard operator meanings
  cvx exec           % Interpret userpath
end
</pre>
	<p>If userpath is an encoded user path, uappend interprets it and
		performs the encoded operations. It does not matter whether the
		userpath object is literal or executable.</p>
	<p>Note that uappend uses the standard definitions of all operator
		names mentioned in the user path, unaffected by any name redefinition
		that may have occurred.</p>
	<p>
		A ucache appearing in userpath may or may not have an effect,
		depending on the environment in which uappend is executed. If the
		current path is initially empty and no path construction operators are
		executed after uappend, a subsequent painting operator may access the
		user path cache. Otherwise, it definitely will not. This is
		particularly useful in the case of <a href="../c/clip.html">clip</a>
		and <a href="../v/viewclip.html">viewclip</a>.
	</p>
	<p>uappend performs a temporary adjustment to the current
		transformation matrix as part of its execution. This adjustment
		consists of rounding the tx and ty components of the CTM to the
		nearest integer values.</p>
