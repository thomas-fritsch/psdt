	<pre>dict key <b>undef</b> -</pre>
	<p>removes key and its associated value from the dictionary dict.
		dict does not need to be on the dictionary stack. No error occurs if
		key is not present in dict.</p>
	<p>If the value of dict is in local VM, the effect of undef can be
		undone by a subsequent restore. That is, if key was present in dict at
		the time of the matching save, restore will reinstate key and its
		former value. But if dict is in global VM, the effect of undef is
		permanent.</p>
