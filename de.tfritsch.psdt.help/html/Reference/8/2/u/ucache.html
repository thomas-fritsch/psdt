		notifies the PostScript interpreter that the user path in which the
		operator occurs is to be retained in the user path cache if it is not
		already there (see Section <a href="../../../4/6/3.html">4.6.3,
			"User Path Cache"</a>). If present, this operator must appear as the
		first element of a user path definition (before the mandatory <a
			href="../s/setbbox.html">setbbox</a>); if executed outside a user
		path definition, the operator does nothing.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>ucache</b> operator has no effect of its own when executed. It
		is useful only with a user path painting operator, such as <a
			href="ufill.html">ufill</a> or <a href="ustroke.html">ustroke</a>,
		that takes the enclosing user path as an operand. If the user path is
		not already in the cache, the painting operator performs the path
		construction operations specified in the user path definition and
		places the results (referred to as the <i>reduced path</i>) in the
		cache. If the user path is already present in the cache, the painting
		operator does not interpret the user path, but rather obtains and uses
		the reduced path from the cache.
