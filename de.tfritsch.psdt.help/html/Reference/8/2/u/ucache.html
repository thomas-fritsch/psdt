	<b>ucache</b> LEVEL 2
	<pre>- <b>ucache</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		notifies the PostScript interpreter that the enclosing user path is to
		be retained in the cache if it is not already there. If present, this
		operator must appear as the first element of a user path definition
		(before the mandatory <a href="../s/setbbox.html">setbbox</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		The ucache operator has no effect of its own when executed; if
		executed outside a user path definition, it does nothing. It is useful
		only with a user path painting operator, such as <a href="ufill.html">ufill</a>
		or <a href="ustroke.html">ustroke</a>, that takes the user path as an
		operand. If the user path is not already in the cache, the painting
		operator performs the path construction operations specified in the
		user path and places the results (referred to as the reduced path) in
		the cache. If the user path is already present in the cache, the
		painting operator does not interpret the user path, but rather obtains
		the reduced path from the cache.
