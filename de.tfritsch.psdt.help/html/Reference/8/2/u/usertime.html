	<h3>usertime</h3>
	<pre>- <b>usertime</b> int</pre>
	<p>returns the value of a clock that is incremented by 1 for every
		millisecond of execution by the PostScript interpreter. The value has
		no defined meaning in terms of calendar time or time of day; its only
		use is interval timing. The accuracy and stability of the clock
		depends on the environment in which the PostScript interpreter is
		running. As the time value becomes greater than the largest integer
		allowed in the implementation, it wraps to the smallest (most
		negative) integer.</p>
	<p>
		In an interpreter that supports multiple execution contexts, the value
		returned by <b>usertime</b> reports execution time on behalf of the
		current context only.
