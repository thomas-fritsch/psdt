	<b>usertime</b>
	<pre>- <b>usertime</b> int</pre>
	<p>returns the value of a clock that increments by 1 for every
		millisecond of execution by the PostScript interpreter. The value has
		no defined meaning in terms of calendar time or time of day; its only
		use is interval timing. The accuracy and stability of the clock
		depends on the environment in which the PostScript interpreter is
		running. As the time value becomes greater than the largest integer
		allowed in the implementation, it wraps to the smallest (most
		negative) integer.</p>
	<p>In a Display PostScript system that supports multiple execution
		contexts, the value returned by usertime reports execution time on
		behalf of the current context only. A context that executes usertime
		can subsequently execute with reduced efficiency, because in order to
		perform user time accounting, the PostScript interpreter must perform
		an operating system call whenever it switches control to and from that
		context. Therefore, one should not execute usertime gratuitously.</p>
