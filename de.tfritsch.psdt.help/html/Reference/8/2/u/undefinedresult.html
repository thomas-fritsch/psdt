	<b>undefinedresult</b> (error)
	<p>A numeric computation would produce a meaningless result or one
		that cannot be represented as a number. Possible causes include
		numeric overflow or underflow, division by zero, or inverse
		transformation of a non-invertible matrix. A large number of graphics
		and font operators can generate an undefinedresult error if the CTM is
		not invertible (scaled by zero, for instance).</p>
