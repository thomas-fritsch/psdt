	<h3>undefinedresult (error)</h3>
	<p>
		A numeric computation would produce a meaningless result or one that
		cannot be represented as a number. Possible causes include numeric
		overflow or underflow, division by 0, or inverse transformation of a
		noninvertible matrix. A large number of graphics and font operators
		can generate an <b>undefinedresult</b> error if the current
		transformation matrix is not invertible (if it is scaled by 0, for
		instance). See <a href="../../../B.html">Appendix B</a> for the limits
		of the values representable as integers and real numbers.
