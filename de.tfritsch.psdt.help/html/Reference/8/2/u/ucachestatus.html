	<b>ucachestatus</b> LEVEL 2
	<pre>- <b>ucachestatus</b> mark bsize bmax rsize rmax blimit</pre>
	<p>
		reports the current consumption and limit for two user path cache
		resources: bytes of reduced path storage (bsize and bmax) and total
		number of cached reduced paths (rsize and rmax). It also reports the
		limit on the number of bytes occupied by a single reduced path
		(blimit)-reduced paths that are larger than this are not cached. All
		ucachestatus results except blimit are for information only. A
		PostScript language program can change blimit (see <a
			href="../s/setucacheparams.html">setucacheparams</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		The number of values pushed on the operand stack is variable. Future
		versions of the PostScript interpreter may push additional values
		between mark and bsize. The purpose of the mark is to delimit the
		values returned by ucachestatus. This enables a program to determine
		how many values were returned (by <a href="../c/counttomark.html">counttomark</a>)
		and to discard any unused ones (by <a href="../c/cleartomark.html">cleartomark</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		The bsize, bmax, and blimit parameters reported by ucachestatus are
		the same as the CurUPathCache and MaxUPathCache system parameters and
		MaxUPathItem user parameter reported by <a
			href="../c/currentsystemparams.html">currentsystemparams</a> and <a
			href="../c/currentuserparams.html">currentuserparams</a>,
		respectively.
