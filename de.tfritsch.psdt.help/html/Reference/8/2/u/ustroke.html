	<b>ustroke</b> LEVEL 2
	<pre>       userpath <b>ustroke</b> -
userpath matrix <b>ustroke</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		interprets a user path definition and strokes the resulting path as if
		by <a href="../s/stroke.html">stroke</a>. The entire operation is
		effectively enclosed by <a href="../g/gsave.html">gsave</a> and <a
			href="../g/grestore.html">grestore</a>, so ustroke has no lasting
		effect on the graphics state.
	</p>
	<p>In the first form (with no matrix operand), ustroke is
		equivalent to:</p>
	<pre>
gsave
  newpath
  uappend
  stroke
grestore
</pre>
	<p>In the second form, ustroke concatenates matrix to the CTM after
		interpreting userpath, but before executing stroke. The matrix applies
		to the line width and the dash pattern, if any, but not to the path
		itself. This form of ustroke is equivalent to:</p>
	<pre>
gsave
  newpath
  exch uappend      % Interpret userpath
  concat           % Concat matrix to CTM
  stroke
grestore
</pre>
	<p>The main use of the second form of ustroke is to compensate for
		variations in line width and dash pattern that occur if the CTM has
		been scaled by different amounts in x and y. This is accomplished by
		defining matrix to be the inverse of the unequal scaling
		transformation.</p>
