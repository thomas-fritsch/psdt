	<h3>undefined (error)</h3>
	<p>
		A name used as a dictionary key in some context cannot be found. This
		occurs if a name is looked up explicitly in a specified dictionary (<a
			href="../g/get.html">get</a>) or in the current dictionary stack (<a
			href="../l/load.html">load</a>) and is not found. It also occurs if
		an executable name is encountered by the interpreter and is not found
		in any dictionary on the dictionary stack.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few PostScript operators are disabled in certain contexts&mdash;for
		example, it is illegal to execute <a href="../i/image.html">image</a>,
		or operators that specify colors or set color-related parameters in
		the graphics state, after a <a href="../s/setcachedevice.html">setcachedevice</a>
		or <a href="../s/setcachedevice2.html">setcachedevice2</a> in a <b>BuildChar</b>
		or <b>BuildGlyph</b> procedure. Attempting to execute such disabled
		operators results in an <b>undefined</b> error.
