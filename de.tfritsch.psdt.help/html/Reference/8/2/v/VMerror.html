	<b>VMerror</b> (error)
	<p>An error has occurred in the virtual memory (VM) machinery. The
		most likely problems are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An attempt to create a new composite object (string, array,
			dictionary, or packed array) would exhaust VM resources. Either the
			program's requirements exceed available capacity or, more likely, the
			program has failed to use the save/restore facility appropriately.</li>
		<li>The interpreter has attempted to perform an operation that
			should be impossible due to access restrictions (for example, store
			into systemdict, which is read-only). This represents an internal
			error in the interpreter. The default handler for this error, unlike
			those for all other errors, does not snapshot the stacks.</li>
	</ul>
