	<h3>VMerror (error)</h3>
	<p>An error has occurred in the virtual memory (VM) machinery. The
		most likely problems are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An attempt to create a new composite object (string, array,
			dictionary, or packed array) would exhaust VM resources. Either the
			program's requirements exceed available capacity or, more likely, the
			program has failed to use the <a>save</a>-<a>restore</a> facility
			appropriately (see Section <a href="../../../3/7.html">3.7,
				"Memory Management"</a>).
		</li>
		<li>The interpreter has attempted to perform an operation that
			should be impossible due to access restrictions (for example, storing
			into <a href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>, which is
			read-only). This represents an internal error in the interpreter.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The default handler for this error, unlike those for all other
		errors, does not snapshot the stacks.</p>
