		Garbage collection causes the memory occupied by the values of
		inaccessible objects to be reclaimed and made available for reuse. It
		does not have any effects that are visible to the PostScript program.
		There is normally no need to execute the <b>vmreclaim</b> operator,
		because garbage collection is invoked automatically when necessary.
		However, there are a few situations in which this operator may be
		useful:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In an interactive application that is temporarily idle, an
			immediate garbage collection can be invoked to put the idle time to
			good use. This defers the need to perform an automatic collection
			subsequently. In a context that is under the control of a job server
			(described in Section <a href="../../../3/7/7.html">3.7.7, "Job
				Execution Environment"</a>), garbage collection is invoked automatically
			between jobs.
		</li>
		<li>For meaningful results when monitoring the VM consumption of
			a program, garbage collection must be invoked before <a
			href="vmstatus.html">vmstatus</a> is executed.
		</li>
		<li>For repeatable results when measuring a program's execution
			time, automatic garbage collection must be disabled.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The negative values that disable garbage collection apply only
		to the current execution context; they do not prevent collection from
		occurring during execution of other contexts. Note that disabling
		garbage collection for too long may eventually cause a program to run
		out of memory and fail with a VMerror.</p>
	<p>
		Executing <b>vmreclaim</b> with an operand of 0, -1, or -2 has the
		same effect as setting the <b>VMReclaim</b> user parameter to the same
		value by means of <a href="../s/setuserparams.html">setuserparams</a>
		(see <a href="../../../C.html">Appendix C</a>).
