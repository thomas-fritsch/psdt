	<b>vmreclaim</b> LEVEL 2
	<pre>int <b>vmreclaim</b> -</pre>
	<p>controls the garbage collection machinery as specified by int:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>-2</dt>
		<dd>Disable automatic collection in both local and global VM.</dd>
		<dt>-1</dt>
		<dd>Disable automatic collection in local VM.</dd>
		<dt>0</dt>
		<dd>Enable automatic collection.</dd>
		<dt>1</dt>
		<dd>Perform immediate collection in local VM.</dd>
		<dt>2</dt>
		<dd>Perform immediate collection in local and global VM.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>This can take a long time, because it must consult the local VMs
		of all execution contexts. Garbage collection causes the memory
		occupied by the values of inaccessible objects to be reclaimed and
		made available for reuse. It does not have any effects that are
		visible to the PostScript language program. There is normally no need
		to execute the vmreclaim operator, because garbage collection is
		invoked automatically when necessary. However, there are a few
		situations in which this operator may be useful: o In an interactive
		application that is temporarily idle, the idle time can be put to good
		use by invoking an immediate garbage collection. This defers the need
		to perform an automatic collection subsequently. In a context that is
		under the control of a job server.</p>
	<p>garbage collection is invoked automatically between jobs.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When monitoring the VM consumption of a program, one must
			invoke garbage collection before executing vmstatus to obtain
			meaningful results.</li>
		<li>When measuring the execution time of a program, one must
			disable automatic garbage collection to obtain repeatable results.
			The negative values that disable garbage collection apply only to the
			current execution context; that is, they do not prevent collection
			from occurring during execution of other contexts.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that disabling garbage collection for too long may
		eventually cause a program to run out of memory and fail with a
		VMerror. Executing vmreclaim with an operand of 0, -1, or -2 has the
		same effect as setting the VMReclaim user parameter to the same value
		by means of setuserparams.</p>
