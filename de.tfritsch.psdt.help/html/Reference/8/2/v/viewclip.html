	<pre>- <b>viewclip</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		replaces the current view clipping path by a copy of the current path
		in the graphics state; see section <a href="../../../DPS/3/1.html">7.3.1,
			"View Clipping."</a> The inside of the current path is determined by the
		normal non-zero winding number rule. <b>viewclip</b> implicitly closes
		any open subpaths of the view clipping path. After setting the view
		clip, <b>viewclip</b> resets the current path to empty, as if by <a
			href="../n/newpath.html">newpath</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>viewclip</b> is similar to <a href="../c/clip.html">clip</a> in
		that it causes subsequent painting operations to affect only those
		areas of the current page that lie inside the new view clipping path.
		However, it differs from <a href="../c/clip.html">clip</a> in three
		important respects:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The view clipping path is independent of the current clipping
			path, which is unaffected. A subsequent <a href="../c/clippath.html">clippath</a>
			returns the current clipping path, uninfluenced by the additional
			clipping imposed by the view clip.
		</li>
		<li><b>viewclip</b> entirely replaces the current view clipping
			path, whereas <a href="../c/clip.html">clip</a> computes the
			intersection of the current and new clipping paths.</li>
		<li><b>viewclip</b> performs an implicit <a
			href="../n/newpath.html">newpath</a> at the end of its execution,
			whereas <a href="../c/clip.html">clip</a> leaves the current path
			unchanged.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The view clipping path is independent of the graphics state; it is
		maintained separately for each execution context. Modifications to the
		view clipping path obey <a href="../s/save.html">save</a> and <a
			href="../r/restore.html">restore</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The view clipping path can be described by a user path (see section <a
			href="../../../4/4.html">4.4, "Path Construction"</a>). This is
		accomplished by:
	<pre>newpath <i>userpath</i> uappend viewclip</pre>
	If
	<i>userpath</i> specifies
	<a href="../u/ucache.html">ucache</a>, this operation may take
	advantage of information in the user path cache.
