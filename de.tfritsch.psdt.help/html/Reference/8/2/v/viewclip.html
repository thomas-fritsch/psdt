	<p>
		replaces the current view clipping path by a copy of the current path
		in the graphics state. The inside of the current path is determined by
		the normal non-zero winding number rule. viewclip implicitly closes
		any open subpaths of the view clipping path. After setting the view
		clip, viewclip resets the current path to empty, as if by newpath.
		viewclip is similar to <a href="../c/clip.html">clip</a> in that it
		causes subsequent painting operations to affect only those areas of
		the current page that lie inside the new view clipping path. However,
		it differs from clip in three important respects:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The view clipping path is independent of the current clipping
			path, which is unaffected. A subsequent <a href="../c/clippath.html">clippath</a>
			returns the current clipping path, uninfluenced by the additional
			clipping imposed by the view clip.
		</li>
		<li>viewclip entirely replaces the current view clipping path,
			whereas clip computes the intersection of the current and new
			clipping paths.</li>
		<li>viewclip performs an implicit <a href="../n/newpath.html">newpath</a>
			at the end of its execution, whereas clip leaves the current path
			unchanged.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The view clipping path is independent of the graphics state; it
		is maintained separately for each execution context. Modifications to
		the view clipping path obey save and restore. The view clipping path
		can be described by a user path. This is accomplished by: newpath
		userpath uappend viewclip If userpath specifies ucache, this operation
		may take advantage of information in the user path cache.</p>
