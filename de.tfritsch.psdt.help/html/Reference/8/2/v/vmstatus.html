	<h3>vmstatus</h3>
	<pre>- <b>vmstatus</b> level used maximum</pre>
	<p>returns three integers describing the state of the PostScript
		interpreter's virtual memory (VM).</p>
	<p>level is the current depth of save nesting-in other words, the
		number of saves that haven't been matched by a restore. used and
		maximum measure VM resources in units of 8-bit bytes; used is the
		number of bytes currently in use and maximum is the maximum available
		capacity.</p>
	<p>
		VM consumption is monitored separately for local and global VM. The
		used and maximum values apply to either local or global VM according
		to the current VM allocation mode (see <a href="../s/setglobal.html">setglobal</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		The used value is meaningful only immediately after a garbage
		collection has taken place (see <a href="vmreclaim.html">vmreclaim</a>).
		At other times, it may be too large because it includes memory
		occupied by objects that have become inaccessible, but have not yet
		been reclaimed.
	</p>
	<p>The maximum value is an estimate of the maximum size to which
		the current VM (local or global) could grow, assuming that all other
		uses of available memory remain constant. Because that assumption is
		never valid in practice, there is some uncertainty about the maximum
		value. Also, in some environments (workstations, for instance), the
		PostScript interpreter can obtain more memory from the operating
		system. In this case, memory is essentially inexhaustible and the
		maximum value is meaningless-it is an extremely large number.</p>
