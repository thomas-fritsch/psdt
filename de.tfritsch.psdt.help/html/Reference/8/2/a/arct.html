	<b>arct</b> LEVEL 2

	<p>
		appends an arc of a circle to the current path, possibly preceded by a
		straight line segment. The arc is defined by a radius r and two
		tangent lines.The tangent lines are those drawn from the current
		point, here called (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>), to (x<sub>1</sub>,
		y<sub>1</sub>), and from (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) to (x<sub>2</sub>,
		y<sub>2</sub>). If the current point is undefined, arct executes the
		error <a href="../n/nocurrentpoint.html">nocurrentpoint</a>.
	<p>
		The center of the arc is located within the inner angle between the
		tangent lines. It is the only point located at distance r in a
		direction perpendicular to both lines. The arc begins at the first
		tangent point (xt<sub>1</sub>, yt<sub>1</sub>) on the first tangent
		line, passes between its center and the point (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>),
		and ends at the second tangent point (xt<sub>2</sub>, yt<sub>2</sub>)
		on the second tangent line.
	<p>
		Before constructing the arc, arct adds a straight line segment from
		the current point (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) to (xt<sub>1</sub>,
		yt<sub>1</sub>), unless those points are the same. In any event, (xt<sub>2</sub>,
		yt<sub>2</sub>) becomes the new current point.
	<p>The curve produced is circular in user space. If user space is
		scaled non-uniformly (i.e., differently in x and y) arct will produce
		elliptical curves in device space.
	<p>
		If the two tangent lines are collinear, arct merely appends a straight
		line segment from (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) to (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>),
		considering the arc to be part of a degenerate circle with radius 0 at
		that point.
