	<h3>arc</h3>
	<pre>x y r angle<sub>1</sub> angle<sub>2</sub> <b>arc</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		appends an arc of a circle to the current path, possibly preceded by a
		straight line segment. The arc is centered at coordinates (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)
		in user space, with radius <i>r</i>. The operands <i>angle<sub>1</sub></i>
		and <i>angle<sub>2</sub></i> define the endpoints of the arc by
		specifying the angles of the vectors joining them to the center of the
		arc. The angles are measured in degrees counterclockwise from the
		positive <i>x</i> axis of the current user coordinate system (see
		Figure 8.1).

	<p>
		The arc produced is circular in user space. If user space is scaled
		nonuniformly (that is, differently in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
		dimensions), the resulting curve will be elliptical in device space.
	</p>
	<p>If there is a current point, a straight line segment from the
		current point to the first endpoint of the arc is added to the current
		path preceding the arc itself. If the current path is empty, this
		initial line segment is omitted. In either case, the second endpoint
		of the arc becomes the new current point.</p>
	<p>
	<p>
		If <i>angle<sub>2</sub></i> is less than <i>angle<sub>1</sub></i>, it
		is increased by multiples of 360 until it becomes greater than or
		equal to <i>angle<sub>1</sub></i>. No other adjustments are made to
		the two angles. In particular, the angle subtended by the arc is not
		reduced modulo 360; if the difference <i>angle<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>angle<sub>1</sub></i>
		exceeds 360, the resulting path will trace portions of the circle more
		than once.
	</p>
	<p>
		The arc is represented internally by one or more cubic BÃ©zier curves
		(see <a href="../c/curveto.html">curveto</a>) approximating the
		required shape. This is done with sufficient accuracy to produce a
		faithful rendition of the required arc. However, a program that reads
		the constructed path using <a href="../p/pathforall.html">pathforall</a>
		will encounter <a href="../c/curveto.html">curveto</a> segments where
		arcs were specified originally.

	<p>This example constructs a 45-degree &quot;pie slice&quot; with a
		1-unit radius, centered at the coordinate origin (see Figure 8.2).</p>
