	<p>
		appends a counterclockwise arc of a circle to the current path,
		possibly preceded by a straight line segment. The arc has (x, y) as
		center, r as radius, ang<sub>1</sub> the angle of a vector from (x, y)
		of length r to the first endpoint of the arc, and ang<sub>2</sub> the
		angle of a vector from (x, y) of length r to the second endpoint of
		the arc. arc
	<p>If there is a current point, the arc operator includes a
		straight line segment from the current point to the first endpoint of
		this arc and then adds the arc into the current path. If the current
		path is empty, the arc operator does not produce the initial straight
		line segment. In any event, the second endpoint of the arc becomes the
		new current point.
	<p>Angles are measured in degrees counterclockwise from the
		positive x-axis of the current user coordinate system. The curve
		produced is circular in user space. If user space is scaled
		non-uniformly (i.e., differently in x and y) arc will produce
		elliptical curves in device space.
	<p>
		The operators that produce arcs (<a href="arc.html"></a>, <a
			href="arcn.html">arcn</a>, <a href="arct.html">arct</a>, and <a
			href="arcto.html">arcto</a> represent them internally as one or more
		Bezier cubic curves. This is done with sufficient accuracy that a
		faithful rendition of an arc is produced. However, a program that
		reads the constructed path using pathforall will encounter <a
			href="../c/curveto.html">curveto</a> segments where arcs were
		specified originally.

		<b>Example</b>
	<pre>
newpath
  0 0 moveto
  0 0 1 0 45 arc
closepath
</pre>
	This constructs a 1-unit radius, 45-degree &quot;pie slice.&quot;
