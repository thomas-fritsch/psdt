	<h3>writestring</h3>
	<pre>file string <b>writestring</b> -</pre>
	<p>writes the characters of string to the output file file.
		writestring does not append a newline character or interpret the value
		of string, which can contain arbitrary binary data. However, the
		communication channel may usurp certain control characters or impose
		other restrictions.</p>
	<p>
		As is the case for all operators that write to files, the output
		produced by writestring may accumulate in a buffer instead of being
		transmitted immediately. To ensure immediate transmission, a <a
			href="../f/flushfile.html">flushfile</a> is required.
