	<h3>wtranslation [DPS]</h3>
	<pre>- <b>wtranslation</b> x y</pre>
	<p>
		returns the translation from the window origin to the PostScript
		interpreter's device space origin. The integers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
		are the amounts that need to be added to a window system coordinate to
		produce the device space coordinate for the same position.
	</p>
	<p>
		That coordinate may in turn be transformed to user space by the <a
			href="../i/itransform.html">itransform</a> operator. Window system
		and device space coordinates always correspond in resolution and
		orientation; they differ only in the positions of their origins. The
		translation from one origin to the other may change as windows are
		moved and resized. The precise behavior is window system specific.
