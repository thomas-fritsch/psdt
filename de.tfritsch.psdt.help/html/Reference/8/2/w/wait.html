	<h3>wait [DPS]</h3>
	<pre>lock condition <b>wait</b> -</pre>
	<p>releases lock, waits for condition to be notified by some other
		execution</p>
	<p>
		context, and finally reacquires lock. The lock must originally have
		been acquired by the current context, which means that wait can be
		invoked only within the execution of a monitor that references the
		same <a href="../l/lock.html">lock</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If lock is initially held by some other context or is not held by any
		context, wait executes an <a href="../i/invalidcontext.html">invalidcontext</a>
		error. On the other hand, during the wait for condition, the lock can
		be acquired by some other context. After condition is notified, wait
		will wait an arbitrary length of time to reacquire <a
			href="../l/lock.html">lock</a>.
	</p>
	<p>If the current context has previously executed a save not yet
		matched by a restore, wait executes invalidcontext unless both lock
		and condition are in global VM. The latter case is permitted under the
		assumption that the wait is synchronizing with some context whose
		local VM is different from that of the current context.</p>
