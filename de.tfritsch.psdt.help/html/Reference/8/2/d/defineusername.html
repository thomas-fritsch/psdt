	<b>defineusername</b> DPS
	<pre>index name <b>defineusername</b> -</pre>
	<p>establishes an association between the non-negative integer
		index and the name object name in the user name table. Subsequently,
		the scanner will substitute name when it encounters any binary encoded
		name token or object that refers to the specified user name index.
		Because binary encoded names specify their own literal or executable
		attributes, it does not matter whether name is literal or executable.</p>
	<p>The user name table is an adjunct to the current context's local
		VM. The effect of adding an entry to the table is immediately visible
		to all contexts that share the same local VM. Additions to the table
		are not affected by save and restore. The association between index
		and name persists for the remaining lifetime of the local VM.</p>
	<p>
		The specified index must previously be unused in the name table or
		must already be associated with the same name. Changing an existing
		association is not permitted (an <a href="../i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a>
		error will occur). There may be an implementation limit on index
		values. Assigning index values sequentially starting at zero is
		strongly recommended.
