	<b>dictfull</b> (error)
	<p>occurs when def, put, or store attempts to define a new entry in
		a dictionary that is already full-in other words, whose length and
		maxlength are already equal. This can occur only in Level 1
		implementations, where a dictionary has a fixed limit on the number of
		entries with distinct keys it can hold. This limit is established by
		the operand to the dict operator that creates the dictionary.</p>
