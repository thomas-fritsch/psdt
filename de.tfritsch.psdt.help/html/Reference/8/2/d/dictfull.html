	<h3>dictfull (error)</h3>
	<p>
		occurs when <a href="def.html">def</a>, <a href="../p/put.html">put</a>,
		or <a href="../s/store.html">store</a> attempts to define a new entry
		in a dictionary that is already full&mdash;in other words, whose <a
			href="../l/length.html">length</a> and <a href="../m/maylength.html">maxlength</a>
		are already equal. This can occur only in Level 1 implementations,
		where a dictionary has a fixed limit on the number of entries with
		distinct keys it can hold. This limit is established by the operand to
		the <a href="dict.html">dict</a> operator that creates the dictionary.
