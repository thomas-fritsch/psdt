	<h3>dict</h3>
	<pre>int <b>dict</b> dict</pre>
	<p>
		creates an empty dictionary with an initial capacity of <i>int</i>
		elements and pushes the created dictionary object on the operand
		stack. <i>int</i> is expected to be a nonnegative integer. The
		dictionary is allocated in local or global VM according to the VM
		allocation mode (see Section <a href="../../../3/7/2.html">3.7.2,
			"Local and Global VM"</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		In Level 1 implementations, the resulting dictionary has a maximum
		capacity of <i>int</i> elements. Attempting to exceed that limit
		causes a <a href="dictfull.html">dictfull</a> error.
	</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevels 2 and 3, the int operand specifies only the initial
		capacity; the dictionary can grow beyond that capacity if necessary.
		The <b>dict</b> operator immediately consumes sufficient VM to hold <i>int</i>
		entries. If more than that number of entries are subsequently stored
		in the dictionary, additional VM is consumed at that time.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a cost associated with expanding a dictionary beyond its
		initial allocation. For efficiency reasons, a dictionary is expanded
		in chunks rather than one element at a time, so it may contain a
		substantial amount of unused space. If a program knows how large a
		dictionary it needs, it should create one of that size initially. On
		the other hand, if a program cannot predict how large the dictionary
		will eventually grow, it should choose a small initial allocation
		sufficient for its immediate needs. The built-in writable dictionaries
		(for example, <a href="../u/userdict.html">userdict</a>) follow the
		latter convention.
