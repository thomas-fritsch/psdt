	<p>
		paints a line centered on the current path, with sides parallel to the
		path segments. The line's graphical properties are defined by various
		parameters of the graphics state. Its thickness is determined by the
		current line width parameter (see <a href="setlinewidth.html">setlinewidth</a>)
		and its color by the current color (see <a href="setcolor.html">setcolor</a>).
		The joints between connected path segments and the ends of open
		subpaths are painted with the current line join (see <a
			href="setlinejoin.html">setlinejoin</a>) and the current line cap
		(see <a href="setlinecap.html">setlinecap</a>), respectively. The line
		is either solid or broken according to the dash pattern established by
		<a href="setdash.html">setdash</a>. Uniform stroke width can be
		ensured by enabling automatic stroke adjustment (see <a
			href="setstrokeadjust.html">setstrokeadjust</a>). All of these
		graphics state parameters are consulted at the time <a
			href="stroke.html">stroke</a> is executed; their values during the
		time the path is being constructed are irrelevant.
	</p>
	<p>
		If a subpath is degenerate (consists of a single-point closed path or
		of two or more points at the same coordinates), <a href="stroke.html">stroke</a>
		paints it only if round line caps have been specified, producing a
		filled circle centered at the single point. If butt or projecting
		square line caps have been specified, <a href="stroke.html">stroke</a>
		produces no output, because the orientation of the caps would be
		indeterminate. A subpath consisting of a singlepoint open path
		produces no output.
	</p>
	<p>
		After painting the current path, <a href="stroke.html">stroke</a>
		clears it with an implicit <a href="../n/newpath.html">newpath</a>
		operation. To preserve the current path across a <a href="stroke.html">stroke</a>
		operation, use the sequence
