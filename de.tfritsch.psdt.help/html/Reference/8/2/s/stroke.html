	<pre>- <b>stroke</b> -</pre>
	<p>paints a line centered on the current path, with sides parallel
		to the path segments. The lineâ€™s graphical properties are defined by
		various parameters of the graphics state. Its thickness is determined
		by the current line width parameter (see setlinewidth) and its color
		by the current color (see setcolor). The joints between connected path
		segments and the ends of open subpaths are painted with the current
		line join (see setlinejoin) and the current line cap (see setlinecap),
		respectively. The line is either solid or broken according to the dash
		pattern established by setdash. Uniform stroke width can be ensured by
		enabling automatic stroke adjustment (see setstrokeadjust). All of
		these graphics state parameters are consulted at the time stroke is
		executed; their values during the time the path is being constructed
		are irrelevant.</p>
	<p>If a subpath is degenerate (consists of a single-point closed
		path or of two or more points at the same coordinates), stroke paints
		it only if round line caps have been specified, producing a filled
		circle centered at the single point. If butt or projecting square line
		caps have been specified, stroke produces no output, because the
		orientation of the caps would be indeterminate. A subpath consisting
		of a singlepoint open path produces no output.</p>
	<p>After painting the current path, stroke clears it with an
		implicit newpath operation. To preserve the current path across a
		stroke operation, use the sequence</p>
