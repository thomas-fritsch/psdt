	<h3>setlinewidth</h3>
	<pre>num <b>setlinewidth</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		sets the line width parameter in the graphics state to <i>num</i>.
		This parameter controls the thickness of lines to be drawn by
		subsequent invocations of <a href="stroke.html">stroke</a> and related
		operators, such as <a href="../r/rectstroke.html">rectstroke</a> and <a
			href="../u/ustroke.html">ustroke</a>. When stroking a path, <a
			href="stroke.html">stroke</a> paints all points whose perpendicular
		distance from the path in user space is less than or equal to half the
		absolute value of <i>num</i>. The effect produced in device space
		depends on the current transformation matrix (CTM) in effect at the
		time the path is stroked. If the CTM specifies scaling by different
		factors in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> dimensions, the thickness of
		stroked lines in device space will vary according to their
		orientation.
	</p>
	<p>A line width of 0 is acceptable, and is interpreted as the
		thinnest line that can be rendered at device resolution&mdash;1 device
		pixel wide. However, some devices cannot reproduce 1-pixel lines, and
		on high-resolution devices, they are nearly invisible. Since the
		results of rendering such "zero-width" lines are device-dependent,
		their use is not recommended.</p>
	<p>
		The actual line width achieved by <a href="stroke.html">stroke</a> can
		differ from the requested width by as much as 2 device pixels,
		depending on the positions of lines with respect to the pixel grid.
		One can enable automatic stroke adjustment (see <a
			href="setstrokeadjust.html">setstrokeadjust</a>)can be used to ensure
		uniform line width.
