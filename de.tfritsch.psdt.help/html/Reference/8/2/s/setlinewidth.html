	<pre>num <b>setlinewidth</b> -</pre>
	<p>sets the line width parameter in the graphics state to num. This
		controls the thickness of lines rendered by subsequent execution of
		the stroke operator. stroke paints all points whose perpendicular
		distance from the current path in user space is less than or equal to
		one-half the absolute value of num. The effect produced in device
		space depends on the current transformation matrix (CTM) in effect at
		the time of the stroke. If the CTM specifies scaling by different
		factors in the x and y dimensions, the thickness of stroked lines in
		device space will vary according to their orientation.</p>
	<p>A line width of zero is acceptable: It is interpreted as the
		thinnest line that can be rendered at device resolution-in other
		words, one device pixel wide. Some devices cannot reproduce one-pixel
		lines, and on high-resolution devices, such lines are nearly
		invisible. Since the results of rendering such &quot;zero-width&quot;
		lines are device dependent, their use is not recommended.</p>
	<p>
		The actual line width achieved by stroke can differ from the requested
		width by as much as two device pixels, depending on the positions of
		lines with respect to the pixel grid. One can enable automatic stroke
		adjustment (by <a href="setstrokeadjust.html">setstrokeadjust</a>) to
		assure uniform line width.
