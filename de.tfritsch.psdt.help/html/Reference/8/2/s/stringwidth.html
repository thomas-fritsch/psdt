	<p>calculates the change in the current point that would occur if
		string were given as the operand to show with the current font. wx and
		wy are computed by adding together the width vectors of all the
		individual characters in string and converting the result to user
		space. They form a distance vector in x and y describing the width of
		the entire string in user space.</p>
	<p>To obtain the character widths, stringwidth may execute the
		descriptions of one or more of the characters in the current font and
		may cause the results to be placed in the font cache. However,
		stringwidth prevents the graphics operators that are executed from
		painting anything into the current page.</p>
	<p>
		Note that the &quot;width&quot; of a string is defined as movement of
		the current point. It has nothing to do with the dimensions of the
		character outlines (see <a href="../c/charpath.html">charpath</a> and
		<a href="../p/pathbbox.html">pathbbox</a>).
