	<h3>stringwidth</h3>
	<pre>string <b>stringwidth</b> w<sub>x</sub> w<sub>y</sub>
	</pre>
	<p>
		calculates the change in the current point that would occur if <i>string</i>
		were given as the operand to <a href="show.html">show</a> with the
		current font. <i>w<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>w<sub>y</sub></i> are
		computed by adding together the width vectors of all the individual
		glyphs for <i>string</i> and converting the result to user space. They
		form a distance vector in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> dimensions
		describing the width of the glyphs for the entire string in user
		space. See Section <a href="../../../5/4.html">5.4, "Glyph Metric
			Information,"</a> for a discussion of glyph widths.
	</p>
	<p>
		To obtain the glyph widths, <b>stringwidth</b> may execute the
		descriptions of one or more of the glyphs in the current font and may
		cause the results to be placed in the font cache. However, <b>stringwidth</b>
		prevents the graphics operators that are executed from painting
		anything onto the current page.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the width returned by <b>stringwidth</b> is defined as
		movement of the current point. It has nothing to do with the
		dimensions of the character outlines (see <a href="../c/charpath.html">charpath</a>
		and <a href="../p/pathbbox.html">pathbbox</a>).
