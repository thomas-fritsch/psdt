	<h3>setscreen</h3>
	<pre>frequency angle proc <b>setscreen</b> -
  num<sub>1</sub> num<sub>2</sub> halftone <b>setscreen</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		sets the halftone screen parameter in the graphics state (see Section
		<a href="../../../7/4.html">7.4, "Halftones"</a>) as specified by the
		operands. <b>setscreen</b> sets the screen identically for all four
		primary color components of the output device (red, green, blue, and
		gray); this distinguishes it from <a href="setcolorscreen.html">setcolorscreen</a>,
		which sets the four screens independently.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>frequency</i> is a number specifying the screen frequency, measured
		in halftone cells per inch in device space. <i>angle</i> specifies the
		number of degrees by which the cells are rotated counterclockwise with
		respect to the device coordinate system. (Note, however, that most
		output devices have left-handed device spaces; on such devices, a
		counterclockwise angle in device space will correspond to a clockwise
		angle in default user space and on the physical medium.)
	</p>
	<p>
		In the first form of the operator, the <i>proc</i> operand is a
		PostScript procedure defining the <i>spot function</i>, which
		determines the order in which pixels within a halftone cell are
		whitened to produce any desired shade of gray. In the second form, <i>halftone</i>
		is a halftone dictionary defining the desired screen; in this case, <b>setscreen</b>
		performs the equivalent of <a href="sethalftone.html">sethalftone</a>,
		except that if the dictionary is of type 1, the values of the <i>frequency</i>
		and <i>angle</i> operands are copied into the dictionary's <b>Frequency</b>
		and <b>Angle</b> entries, overriding the original values of those
		entries. (If the dictionary is read-only, <b>setscreen</b> makes a
		copy of it before copying the values.) For halftone dictionaries of
		types other than 1, the <i>frequency</i> and <i>angle</i> operands are
		ignored.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <a href="../r/rangecheck.html">rangecheck</a> error occurs if <i>proc</i>
		returns a result outside the range -1.0 to 1.0. A <a
			href="../l/limitcheck.html">limitcheck</a> error occurs if the size
		of the screen cell exceeds implementation limits.
	</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 3, the behavior of <b>setscreen</b> can be altered by
		the user parameters <b>AccurateScreens</b> (see <a
			href="../../../7/4/4.html#1">"Type 1 Halftone Dictionaries" on
			page 487</a>), HalftoneMode (<a href="../../../C/3/4.html#2">"Halftone
			Setting" on page 757</a>), and MaxSuperScreen (Section <a
			href="../../../7/4/8.html">7.4.8, "Supercells"</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Because the effect of the halftone screen is device-dependent,
		setscreen should not be used in a page description that is intended to
		be device-independent. Execution of this operator is not permitted in
		certain circumstances; see Section <a href="../../../4/8/1.html">4.8.1,
			"Types of Color Space."</a>
