	<h3>setscreen</h3>
	<pre>frequency angle proc <b>setscreen</b> -
  num<sub>1</sub> num<sub>2</sub> halftone <b>setscreen</b> -</pre>
	<p>sets the halftone screen parameter in the graphics state (see
		Section 7.4, "Halftones") as specified by the operands. setscreen sets
		the screen identically for all four primary color components of the
		output device (red, green, blue, and gray); this distinguishes it from
		setcolorscreen, which sets the four screens independently.</p>
	<p>frequency is a number specifying the screen frequency, measured
		in halftone cells per inch in device space. angle specifies the number
		of degrees by which the cells are rotated counterclockwise with
		respect to the device coordinate system. (Note, however, that most
		output devices have left-handed device spaces; on such devices, a
		counterclockwise angle in device space will correspond to a clockwise
		angle in default user space and on the physical medium.)</p>
	<p>In the first form of the operator, the proc operand is a
		PostScript procedure defining the spot function, which determines the
		order in which pixels within a halftone cell are whitened to produce
		any desired shade of gray. In the second form, halftone is a halftone
		dictionary defining the desired screen; in this case, setscreen
		performs the equivalent of sethalftone, except that if the dictionary
		is of type 1, the values of the frequency and angle operands are
		copied into the dictionaryâ€™s Frequency and Angle entries, overriding
		the original values of those entries. (If the dictionary is read-only,
		setscreen makes a copy of it before copying the values.) For halftone
		dictionaries of types other than 1, the frequency and angle operands
		are ignored.</p>
	<p>A rangecheck error occurs if proc returns a result outside the
		range -1.0 to 1.0. A limitcheck error occurs if the size of the screen
		cell exceeds implementation limits.</p>
	<p>In LanguageLevel 3, the behavior of setscreen can be altered by
		the user parameters AccurateScreens (see "Type 1 Halftone
		Dictionaries" on page 487), HalftoneMode ("Halftone Setting" on page
		757), and MaxSuperScreen (Section 7.4.8, "Supercells").</p>
	<p>Because the effect of the halftone screen is device-dependent,
		setscreen should not be used in a page description that is intended to
		be device-independent. Execution of this operator is not permitted in
		certain circumstances; see Section 4.8.1, "Types of Color Space."</p>
