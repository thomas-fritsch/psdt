	<p>
		The operand stack has grown too large. Too many objects have been
		pushed on the stack and not popped off. Before invoking this error,
		the interpreter creates an array containing all elements of the
		operand stack (stored as if by <a href="../a/astore.html">astore</a>),
		resets the operand stack to empty, and pushes the array on the operand
		stack.
