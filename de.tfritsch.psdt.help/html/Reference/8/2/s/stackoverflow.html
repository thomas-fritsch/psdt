	<h3>stackoverflow (error)</h3>
	<p>
		The operand stack has grown too large; too many objects have been
		pushed on the stack and not popped off. See <a href="../../../B.html">Appendix
			B</a> for the limit on the size of the operand stack.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before invoking this error, the interpreter creates an array
		containing all elements of the operand stack (stored as if by <a
			href="../a/astore.html">astore</a>), resets the operand stack to
		empty, and pushes the array on the operand stack.
