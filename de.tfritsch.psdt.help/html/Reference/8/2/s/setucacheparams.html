	<h3>setucacheparams [LEVEL 2]</h3>
	<pre>mark blimit <b>setucacheparams</b> -</pre>
	<p>sets user path cache parameters as specified by the integer
		objects above the topmost mark on the stack, then removes all operands
		and the mark object itself, as if by cleartomark.</p>
	<p>The number of cache parameters is variable. If more operands are
		supplied than are needed, the topmost ones are used and the remainder
		ignored. If too few are supplied, setucacheparams implicitly inserts
		default values between the mark and the first supplied operand.</p>
	<p>blimit specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be
		occupied by the reduced representation of a single path in the user
		path cache. Any reduced path larger than this limit is not saved in
		the cache. Changing blimit does not disturb any paths that are already
		in the cache. A blimit value that is too large is automatically
		reduced to the maximum permissible value without error indication.</p>
	<p>Modifications to the cache limit parameter are subject to save
		and restore. In an interpreter that supports multiple contexts, this
		parameter is maintained separately for each context.</p>
	<p>The parameter that setucacheparams sets is the same as the
		MaxUPathItem user parameter set by setuserparams (see Appendix C).</p>
