	<h3>setcharwidth</h3>
	<pre>w<sub>x</sub> w<sub>y</sub> <b>setcharwidth</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		is similar to <a href="setcachedevice.html">setcachedevice</a>, but it
		passes only width information to the PostScript interpreter's font
		machinery and it declares that the glyph being defined is not to be
		placed in the font cache.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>setcharwidth</b> is useful in the unusual case of defining glyphs
		that incorporate two or more specific opaque colors, such as opaque
		black and opaque white. Most glyphs have no inherent color, but are
		painted with the current color within the glyph's outline, leaving the
		area outside unpainted (transparent).
	</p>
	<p>
		Another use of <b>setcharwidth</b> is in defining glyphs that
		intentionally change their behavior based on the environment in which
		they execute. Such glyphs must not be cached, because that would
		subvert the intended variable behavior.
