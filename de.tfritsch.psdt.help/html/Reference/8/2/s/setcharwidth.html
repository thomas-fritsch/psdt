	<p>is similar to setcachedevice, but it passes only width
		information to the PostScript interpreter's font machinery and it
		declares that the glyph being defined is not to be placed in the font
		cache.</p>
	<p>setcharwidth is useful in the unusual case of defining glyphs
		that incorporate two or more specific opaque colors, such as opaque
		black and opaque white. Most glyphs have no inherent color, but are
		painted with the current color within the glyph's outline, leaving the
		area outside unpainted (transparent). Another use of setcharwidth is
		in defining glyphs that intentionally change their behavior based on
		the environment in which they execute. Such glyphs must not be cached,
		because that would subvert the intended variable behavior.</p>
