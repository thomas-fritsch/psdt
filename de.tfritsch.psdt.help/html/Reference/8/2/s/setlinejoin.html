	<pre>int <b>setlinejoin</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		sets the line join parameter in the graphics state to <i>int</i>,
		which must be 0, 1, or 2. This parameter controls the shape to be
		painted at corners by subsequent invocations of <a href="stroke.html">stroke</a>
		and related operators, such as <a href="../r/rectstroke.html">rectstroke</a>
		and <a href="../u/ustroke.html">ustroke</a> (see Section <a
			href="../../../4/5/1.html">4.5.1, "Stroking"</a>). Possible values
		are as follows (see Figure 8.10):
	</p>
	<ol start="0">
		<li><i>Miter join.</i> The outer edges of the strokes for the two
			segments are extended until they meet at an angle, as in a picture
			frame. If the segments meet at too sharp an angle (as defined by the
			miter limit parameter&mdash;see <a href="setmiterlimit.html">setmiterlimit</a>),
			a bevel join is used instead.</li>
		<li><i>Round join.</i> A circular arc with a diameter equal to
			the line width is drawn around the point where the two segments meet
			and is filled in, producing a rounded corner. stroke draws a full
			circle at this point; if path segments shorter than half the line
			width meet at sharp angles, an unintended "wrong side" of this circle
			may appear</li>
		<li><i>Bevel join.</i> The two segments are finished with butt
			caps (see <a href="setlinecap.html">setlinecap</a>), and the
			resulting notch beyond the ends of the segments is filled with a
			triangle.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Join styles are significant only at points where consecutive segments
		of a path connect at an angle. Segments that meet or intersect
		fortuitously receive no special treatment. Curved segments are
		actually rendered as sequences of straight line segments, and the
		current line join is applied to the "corners" between these segments.
		However, for typical values of the flatness parameter (see <a
			href="setflat.html">setflat</a>), the corners are so shallow that the
		difference between join styles is not visible.
