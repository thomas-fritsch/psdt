	<pre>int <b>setlinejoin</b> -</pre>
	<p>sets the line join parameter in the graphics state to int, which
		must be one of the integers 0, 1, or 2. This establishes the shape to
		be put at corners in paths painted by the stroke operator. The
		integers select the following shapes:</p>
	<ol start="0">
		<li>Miter join. the outer edges of the strokes for the two
			segments are extended until they meet at an angle, as in a picture
			frame. If the segments meet at too sharp an angle, a bevel join is
			used instead. This is controlled by the miter limit parameter
			established by <a href="setmiterlimit.html">setmiterlimit</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Round join. A circular arc with diameter equal to the line
			width is drawn around the point where the segments meet and is filled
			in, producing a rounded corner. stroke draws a full circle at this
			point. If path segments shorter than one-half the line width meet at
			sharp angles, an unintentional &quot;wrong side&quot; of this circle
			may appear.</li>
		<li>Bevel join. The meeting path segments are finished with butt
			end caps (see <a href="setlinecap.html">setlinecap</a>); then the
			resulting notch beyond the ends of the segments is filled with a
			triangle. Join styles are significant only at points where
			consecutive segments of a path connect at an angle. Segments that
			meet or intersect fortuitously receive no special treatment. Curved
			lines are actually rendered as sequences of straight line segments,
			and the current line join is applied to the &quot;corners&quot;
			between those segments. However, for typical values of the flatness
			parameter (see <a href="setflat.html">setflat</a>), the corners are
			so shallow that the difference between join styles is not visible.
		</li>
