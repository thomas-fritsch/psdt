	<h3>settransfer</h3>
	<pre>proc <b>settransfer</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		sets the transfer function parameter in the graphics state to <i>proc</i>
		(see Section <a href="../../../7/3.html">7.3, "Transfer Functions"</a>).
		A transfer function is a procedure that adjusts the value of a color
		component to compensate for nonlinear response in an output device and
		in the human eye. The procedure is called with a number in the range
		0.0 to 1.0 on the operand stack and must return a number in the same
		range. <b>settransfe</b>r sets the transfer function identically for
		all four primary color components of the output device (red, green,
		blue, and gray); this distinguishes it from <a
			href="setcolortransfer.html">setcolortransfer</a>, which sets the
		four transfer functions independently.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because the effect of the transfer function is device-dependent
		settransfer should not be used in a page description that is intended
		to be device-independent. Execution of this operator is not permitted
		in certain circumstances; see Section <a href="../../../4/8/1.html">4.8.1,
			"Types of Color Space."</a>
