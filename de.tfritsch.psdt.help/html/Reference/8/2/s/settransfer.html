	<p>sets the transfer function parameter in the graphics state to
		proc (see Section 7.3, "Transfer Functions"). A transfer function is a
		procedure that adjusts the value of a color component to compensate
		for nonlinear response in an output device and in the human eye. The
		procedure is called with a number in the range 0.0 to 1.0 on the
		operand stack and must return a number in the same range. settransfer
		sets the transfer function identically for all four primary color
		components of the output device (red, green, blue, and gray); this
		distinguishes it from setcolortransfer, which sets the four transfer
		functions independently.</p>
	<p>Because the effect of the transfer function is device-dependent
		settransfer should not be used in a page description that is intended
		to be device-independent. Execution of this operator is not permitted
		in certain circumstances; see Section 4.8.1, "Types of Color Space."</p>
