	<p>is executed by the PostScript interpreter when it starts up.
		After setting up the virtual memory (restoring it from a file, if
		appropriate), the interpreter executes the name start in the context
		of the default dictionary stack (systemdict, globaldict, and
		userdict). The procedure associated with the name start is expected to
		provide whatever top-level control is requiredâ€”for example, for
		receiving page descriptions, interacting with a user, or recovering
		from errors. The precise definition of start depends on the
		environment in which the PostScript interpreter is operating. It is
		not of any interest to ordinary PostScript programs and the effect of
		executing it explicitly is undefined.</p>
