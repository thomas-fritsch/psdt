	<p>If the operand is a file object, status returns true if it is
		still valid (i.e., is associated with an open file), false otherwise.
		If the operand is a string, status treats it as a file name according
		to the conventions of &quot;Named Files.&quot; If there is a file by
		that name, status pushes four integers of status information followed
		by the value true; otherwise, it pushes false. The four integer values
		are:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>pages</dt>
		<dd>The storage space occupied by the file, in
			implementationdependent units.</dd>
		<dt>bytes</dt>
		<dd>The length of the file in bytes.</dd>
		<dt>referenced</dt>
		<dd>The date and time the file was last referenced for reading or
			writing. This value is interpreted according to the conventions of
			the underlying operating system. The only assumption that a program
			can make is that larger values indicate later times.</dd>
		<dt>created</dt>
		<dd>The date and time the contents of the file were created. or
			writing.</dd>
