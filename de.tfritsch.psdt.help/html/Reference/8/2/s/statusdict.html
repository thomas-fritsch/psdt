	<pre>- <b>statusdict</b> dict</pre>
	<p>pushes a product-dependent dictionary on the operand stack.
		statusdict is not an operator; it is a name associated with the
		dictionary in systemdict. The statusdict dictionary is in local VM and
		is writable.</p>
	<p>statusdict contains product-dependent operators and other data
		whose names and values vary from product to product, and sometimes
		from one version of a product to another. Information in statusdict is
		associated with unique features of a product that cannot be accessed
		in any standard way. The contents of statusdict are not documented
		here, but in product-specific documentation.</p>
	<p>
		In Level 1 implementations, statusdict includes operators to select
		print-engine features, to set communication parameters, and to control
		other aspects of the interpreter's operating environment. In Level 2,
		most of these functions have been subsumed by standard operators, such
		as <a href="setpagedevice.html">setpagedevice</a>, <a
			href="setdevparams.html">setdevparams</a>, and <a
			href="setsystemparams.html">setsystemparams</a>.
	</p>
	<p>statusdict is not necessarily defined in all products. Any
		reference to statusdict in a PostScript language program impairs the
		portability of that program.</p>
