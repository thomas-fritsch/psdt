	<h3>strokepath</h3>
	<pre>- <b>strokepath</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		replaces the current path with one enclosing the shape of the line
		that the <a href="stroke.html">stroke</a> operator would draw if
		applied to the current path. The result is not influenced by the
		current clipping path. The rules for degenerate subpaths (see <a
			href="stroke.html">stroke</a>) apply to <a href="strokepath.html">strokepath</a>
		as well: if <a href="stroke.html">stroke</a> would produce no output,
		<a href="strokepath.html">strokepath</a> will produce an empty
		subpath.
	</p>
	<p>
		The path produced by <a href="strokepath.html">strokepath</a> is
		suitable for use as the implicit operand to a subsequent <a
			href="../f/fill.html">fill</a>, <a href="../c/clip.html">clip</a>, or
		<a href="../p/pathbbox.html">pathbbox</a> operation. In general, it is
		not suitable for <a href="stroke.html">stroke</a>, as it may contain
		interior segments or disconnected subpaths produced by strokepathâ€™s
		conversion from stroke to outline.
