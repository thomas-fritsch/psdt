	<pre>- <b>strokepath</b> -</pre>
	<p>replaces the current path with one enclosing the shape that
		would result if the stroke operator were applied to the current path.
		The path resulting from strokepath is suitable as the implicit operand
		to fill, clip, or pathbbox. In general, this path is not suitable for
		stroke, as it may contain interior segments or disconnected subpaths
		produced by strokepath's stroke to outline conversion process.</p>
