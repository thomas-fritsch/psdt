	<pre>num <b>setmiterlimit</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		sets the miter limit parameter in the graphics state to num, which
		must be a number greater than or equal to 1. The miter limit controls
		the stroke operator's treatment of corners when miter joins have been
		specified (see <a href="#setlinejoin">setlinejoin</a>). When path
		segments connect at a sharp angle, a miter join results in a spike
		that extends well beyond the connection point. The purpose of the
		miter limit is to cut off such spikes when they become objectionably
		long.
	</p>
	<p>At any given corner, the miter length is the distance from the
		point at which the inner edges of the stroke intersect to the point at
		which the outside edges of the strokes intersect-in other words, the
		diagonal length of the miter. This distance increases as the angle
		between the segments decreases. If the ratio of the miter length to
		the line width exceeds the miter limit parameter, stroke treats the
		corner with a bevel join instead of a miter join.</p>
	<p>The ratio of miter length to line width is directly related to
		the angle j between the segments in user space by the formula:</p>
	<pre>
  miterLength      1
  ----------- = --------
   lineWidth    sin(&phi;/2)
</pre>
	<p>Examples of miter limit values are: 1.415 cuts off miters
		(converts them to bevels) at angles less than 90 degrees, 2.0 cuts off
		miters at angles less than 60 degrees, and 10.0 cuts off miters at
		angles less than 11 degrees. The default value of the miter limit is
		10. Setting the miter limit to 1 cuts off miters at all angles so that
		bevels are always produced even when miters are specified.</p>
