	<b>stopped</b>
	<pre>any <b>stopped</b> bool</pre>
	<p>executes any, which is typically, but not necessarily, a
		procedure, executable file, or executable string object. If any runs
		to completion normally, stopped returns false on the operand stack. If
		any terminates prematurely as a result of executing stop, stopped
		returns true on the operand stack. Regardless of the outcome, the
		interpreter resumes execution at the next object in normal sequence
		after stopped.</p>
	<p>This mechanism provides an effective way for a PostScript
		language program to &quot;catch&quot; errors or other premature
		terminations, retain control, and perhaps perform its own error
		recovery.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
{ ... } stopped
  {handleerror}
if
</pre>
	<p>If execution of the procedure {...} causes an error, the default
		error-reporting procedure is invoked (by handleerror). In any event,
		normal execution continues at the token following the if.</p>
