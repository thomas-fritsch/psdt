	<b>setcachedevice</b>
	<pre>w<sub>x</sub> w<sub>y</sub> ll<sub>x</sub> ll<sub>y</sub> ur<sub>x</sub> ur<sub>y</sub> <b>setcachedevice</b> -</pre>
	<p>passes width and bounding box information to the PostScript
		interpreter's font machinery. setcachedevice can be executed only
		within the context of a BuildGlyph, BuildChar, or CharStrings
		procedure for a font or CIDFont. The procedure must invoke
		setcachedevice, setcachedevice2, or setcharwidth before executing
		graphics operators to define and paint the glyph. setcachedevice
		requests the font machinery to transfer the results of those operators
		both into the font cache, if possible, and onto the current page.</p>
	<p>
		The operands to setcachedevice are all numbers interpreted in the
		glyph coordinate system (see Section 5.4, "Glyph Metric Information").
		w<sub>x</sub> and w<sub>y</sub> define the basic width vector for this
		glyph&mdash;in other words, the normal position of the origin of the
		next glyph relative to origin of this one.
	</p>
	<p>
		ll<sub>x</sub> and ll<sub>y</sub> are the coordinates of the
		lower-left corner, and urx and ury the upperright corner, of the glyph
		bounding box. The glyph bounding box is the smallest rectangle,
		oriented with the glyph coordinate system axes, that completely
		encloses all marks placed on the page as a result of executing the
		glyph's description. For a glyph defined as a path, this may be
		determined by means of the pathbbox operator. The font machinery needs
		this information to make decisions about clipping and caching. The
		declared bounding box must be correct&mdash;in other words,
		sufficiently large to enclose the entire glyph. If any marks fall
		outside this bounding box, the result is unpredictable.
	</p>
	<p>setcachedevice installs identical sets of metrics for writing
		modes 0 and 1, while setcachedevice2 installs separate metrics.</p>
	<p>After execution of setcachedevice and until the termination of
		the BuildGlyph, BuildChar, or CharStrings procedure, invocation of
		color-setting operators or the image operator is not allowed; see
		Section 4.8, "Color Spaces." Note that use of the imagemask operator
		is permitted.</p>
	<p>
		After execution of setcachedevice and until the termination of the
		BuildGlyph or BuildChar procedure, execution of color setting
		operators or image is not allowed. Note that use of the <a
