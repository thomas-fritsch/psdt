	<h3>setbbox</h3>
	<pre>ll<sub>x</sub> ll<sub>y</sub> ur<sub>x</sub> ur<sub>y</sub> <b>setbbox</b> -</pre>
	<p>establishes a bounding box for the current path, within which
		the coordinates of all path construction operators must fall. Any
		subsequent attempt to append a path element with a coordinate lying
		outside the bounding box will cause a rangecheck error; subsequent
		invocations of pathbbox will return a result derived from the bounding
		box rather than from the actual path. The bounding box remains in
		effect for the lifetime of the current path&mdash;that is, until the
		next newpath or any operator that resets the path implicitly.</p>
	<p>
		The operands define a rectangle in user space, oriented with its sides
		parallel to the axes of the user coordinate system: ll<sub>x</sub> and
		ll<sub>y</sub> are the coordinates of the rectangle's lower-left
		corner, ur<sub>x</sub> and ur<sub>y</sub> the upper-right corner. The
		upper-right coordinate values must be greater than or equal to the
		lower-left values, or a rangecheck error will occur. setbbox
		transforms the corners of the specified bounding box from user to
		device coordinates, then constructs the smallest rectangle in device
		space that is oriented parallel to the device space axes and encloses
		all four corners. All subsequent bounding box checking is done in
		device space.
	</p>
	<p>Note that arcs constructed with the arc, arcn, arct, and arcto
		operators are converted to equivalent sequences of curveto operations.
		The coordinates computed as control points for these curves must also
		fall within the bounding box. This establishes a bounding box for the
		current path, within which the coordinates means that the figure of
		the arc must be entirely enclosed by the bounding box. On the other
		hand, the bounding box only constrains the path itself, not the
		results of rendering it. For example, stroking the path may place
		marks outside the bounding box without causing an error.</p>
	<p>Although the setbbox operator can be used for any path, its main
		use is in defining user paths, where it is mandatory (see Section 4.6,
		"User Paths"). Any user path procedure passed to one of the user path
		rendering operators (such as ufill) must begin with a setbbox
		operation (optionally preceded by ucache). The bounding box
		information enables the user path rendering operator to optimize
		execution.</p>
	<p>If setbbox is invoked more than once during the definition of a
		path, the path's effective bounding box is successively enlarged to
		enclose the union of all of the individual bounding boxes specified.
		Such multiple invocation is not permitted within a user path
		definition, but could conceivably arise in building up a single
		current path by concatenating several user paths with multiple
		invocations of uappend.</p>
