	<h3>setbbox</h3>
	<pre>ll<sub>x</sub> ll<sub>y</sub> ur<sub>x</sub> ur<sub>y</sub> <b>setbbox</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		establishes a bounding box for the current path, within which the
		coordinates of all path construction operators must fall. Any
		subsequent attempt to append a path element with a coordinate lying
		outside the bounding box will cause a <a href="../r/rangecheck.html">rangecheck</a>
		error; subsequent invocations of <b>pathbbox</b> will return a result
		derived from the bounding box rather than from the actual path. The
		bounding box remains in effect for the lifetime of the current
		path&mdash;that is, until the next <a href="../n/newpath.html">newpath</a>
		or any operator that resets the path implicitly.
	</p>
	<p>
		The operands define a rectangle in user space, oriented with its sides
		parallel to the axes of the user coordinate system: <i>ll<sub>x</sub></i>
		and <i>ll<sub>y</sub></i> are the coordinates of the rectangle's
		lower-left corner, <i>ur<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>ur<sub>y</sub></i> the
		upper-right corner. The upper-right coordinate values must be greater
		than or equal to the lower-left values, or a <a
			href="../r/rangecheck.html">rangecheck</a> error will occur. <b>setbbox</b>
		transforms the corners of the specified bounding box from user to
		device coordinates, then constructs the smallest rectangle in device
		space that is oriented parallel to the device space axes and encloses
		all four corners. All subsequent bounding box checking is done in
		device space.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that arcs constructed with the <a href="../a/arc.html">arc</a>, <a
			href="../a/arcn.html">arcn</a>, <a href="../a/arct.html">arct</a>,
		and <a href="../a/arcto.html">arcto</a> operators are converted to
		equivalent sequences of <a href="../c/curveto.html">curveto</a>
		operations. The coordinates computed as control points for these
		curves must also fall within the bounding box. This means that the
		figure of the arc must be entirely enclosed by the bounding box. On
		the other hand, the bounding box only constrains the path itself, not
		the results of rendering it. For example, stroking the path may place
		marks outside the bounding box without causing an error.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although the <b>setbbox</b> operator can be used for any path, its
		main use is in defining user paths, where it is mandatory (see Section
		<a href="../../../4/6.html">4.6, "User Paths"</a>). Any user path
		procedure passed to one of the user path rendering operators (such as
		<a href="../u/ufill.html">ufill</a>) must begin with a <b>setbbox</b>
		operation (optionally preceded by <a href="../u/ucache.html">ucache</a>).
		The bounding box information enables the user path rendering operator
		to optimize execution.
	</p>
	<p>
		If <b>setbbox</b> is invoked more than once during the definition of a
		path, the pathâ€™s effective bounding box is successively enlarged to
		enclose the union of all of the individual bounding boxes specified.
		Such multiple invocation is not permitted within a user path
		definition, but could conceivably arise in building up a single
		current path by concatenating several user paths with multiple
		invocations of <a href="../u/uappend.html">uappend</a>.
