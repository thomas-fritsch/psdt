	<p>sets the current color space in the graphics state to Pattern
		and establishes a specified pattern as the current color. Subsequent
		painting operations (except image and colorimage) will use this
		pattern to paint the required areas of the current page.</p>
	<p>setpattern is a convenience operator for patterns that performs
		the equivalent of setcolorspace and setcolor in a single operation. It
		is equivalent to the following code:</p>
	<pre>
currentcolorspace 0 get /Pattern ne
{ [/Pattern currentcolorspace] setcolorspace
} if
setcolor
</pre>
	<p>Normally, setpattern establishes a Pattern color space whose
		underlying color space is the one in effect at the time setpattern is
		invoked. However, if the current color space is already a Pattern
		space, setpattern simply leaves it unchanged.</p>
	<p>setpattern then invokes setcolor to establish the specified
		pattern as the current color in the graphics state, passing it the
		same operand values that were supplied to setpattern itself. The
		pattern operand is a pattern dictionary constructed as specified in
		Section 4.9, "Patterns," and instantiated by makepattern. The need for
		the remaining operands depends on the value of the pattern
		dictionaryâ€™s PatternType and PaintType entries:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Shading patterns (PatternType 2) and colored tiling patterns
			(PatternType 1, PaintType 1) define their own colors as part of the
			pattern itself; there is no underlying color space. Therefore, the
			operands comp1 through compn should not be specified.</li>
		<li>Uncolored tiling patterns (PatternType 1, PaintType 2) have
			no inherent color; the color must be specified explicitly by the
			components comp1 through compn in the underlying color space of the
			Pattern space. If the Pattern color space does not have an underlying
			color space, a rangecheck error occurs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Execution of this operator is not permitted in certain
		circumstances; see Section 4.8.1, "Types of Color Space."</p>
