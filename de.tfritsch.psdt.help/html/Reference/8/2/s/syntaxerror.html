	<h3>syntaxerror (error)</h3>
	<p>
		The scanner has encountered program text that does not conform to the
		PostScript language syntax rules (see Section <a
			href="../../../3/2.html">3.2, "Syntax"</a>). This can occur either
		during interpretation of an executable file or executable string
		object or during explicit invocation of the <a href="./t/token.html">token</a>
		operator.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because the syntax of the PostScript language is simple, the set of
		possible causes for a <b>syntaxerror</b> is very small:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An opening string or procedure bracket &mdash;(, &lt;, &lt;~,
			or {&mdash; is not matched by a corresponding closing bracket before
			the end of the file or string being interpreted</li>
		<li>A closing string or procedure bracket &mdash;), &gt;, ~&gt;,
			or }&mdash; is not matched by a corresponding previous opening
			bracket.</li>
		<li>A character other than a hexadecimal digit or white-space
			character appears within a hexadecimal string literal bracketed by
			&lt;...&gt;.</li>
		<li>An encoding violation occurs in an ASCII base-85 string
			literal bracketed by &lt;~...~&gt;.</li>
		<li>A binary token or binary object sequence has incorrect
			structure (see Section <a href="../../../3/14.html">3.14, "Binary
				Encoding Details"</a>).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Erroneous tokens, such as malformed numbers, do not produce a <b>syntaxerror</b>;
		such tokens are instead treated as name objects (often producing an <a
			href="../u/undefined.html">undefined</a> error when executed). Tokens
		that exceed implementation limits, such as names that are too long or
		numbers whose values are too large, produce a <a
			href="../l/limitcheck.html">limitcheck</a> (see <a
			href="./../../B.html">Appendix B</a>).
