	<b>setdash</b>
	<pre>array offset <b>setdash</b> -</pre>
	<p>sets the dash pattern parameter in the graphics state. This
		parameter controls the lines to be drawn by subsequent invocations of
		stroke and related operators, such as rectstroke and ustroke. An empty
		(zero-length) array operand denotes solid, unbroken lines. If array is
		not empty, its elements (which must be nonnegative numbers and not all
		zero) define the sequence of dashes and gaps constituting the dash
		pattern.</p>
	<p>The elements of array alternately specify the length of a dash
		and the length of a gap between dashes, expressed in units of the user
		coordinate system. The stroke operator uses these elements cyclically;
		when it reaches the end of the array, it starts again at the
		beginning.</p>
	<p>Dashed strokes wrap around curves and corners in the same way as
		solid strokes. The ends of each dash are treated with the current line
		cap, and corners within a dash are treated with the current line join.
		stroke takes no measures to coordinate the dash pattern with features
		of the path itself; it simply dispenses dashes along the path in the
		pattern defined by array. The offset operand can be thought of as the
		"phase" of the dash pattern relative to the start of the path. It is
		interpreted as a distance into the dash pattern (measured in user
		space units) at which to start the pattern. Before beginning to stroke
		a path, the stroke operator cycles through the elements of array,
		adding up distances and alternating dashes and gaps as usual, but
		without generating any output. When the accumulated distance reaches
		the value specified by offset, it begins stroking from the starting
		point of the path, using the dash pattern from the point that has been
		reached. Each subpath of a path is treated independently; the dash
		pattern is restarted and the offset reapplied at the beginning of each
		subpath.</p>
