	<b>setpagedevice</b> LEVEL 2
	<pre>dict <b>setpagedevice</b> -</pre>
	<p>modifies the contents of the page device dictionary in the
		graphics state based on the contents of the dictionary operand. The
		operand is a request dictionary containing requested new values for
		one or more page device parameters. If valid for the current page
		device, these requested values are merged by setpagedevice into the
		current page device dictionary. The interpretation of these parameters
		is described in Section 6.2, "Page Device Parameters."</p>
	<p>The results of setpagedevice are cumulative. The request
		dictionary for any given invocation is not required to include any
		particular keys; parameter values established in previous invocations
		will persist unless explicitly overridden. This cumulative behavior
		applies not only to the top-level dictionary, but also recursively to
		the subdictionaries InputAttributes, OutputAttributes, and Policies,
		as well as to some types of details dictionaries.</p>
	<p>The result of executing setpagedevice is to instantiate a page
		device dictionary, perform the equivalent of initgraphics and
		erasepage, and install the new device dictionary as an implicit part
		of the graphics state. The effects of setpagedevice are subject to
		save and restore, gsave and grestore, and setgstate.</p>
	<p>setpagedevice can be used by system administrators to establish
		a default state for a device by invoking it as part of an
		unencapsulated job (see Section 3.7.7, "Job Execution Environment").
		This default state persists until the next restart of the PostScript
		interpreter. Some PostScript implementations store some of the device
		parameters in persistent storage when setpagedevice is executed as
		part of an unencapsulated job, making those parameters persist through
		interpreter restart.</p>
	<p>setpagedevice reinitializes everything in the graphics state
		except the font parameter, including parameters not affected by
		initgraphics. Device-dependent rendering parameters, such as the
		halftone screen, transfer functions, flatness tolerance, and color
		rendering dictionary, are reset to built-in default values or to ones
		provided in the Install procedure of the page device dictionary.</p>
	<p>When the current device in the graphics state is not a page
		device&mdash;for example, after nulldevice has been invoked or when an
		interactive display device is active&mdash; setpagedevice creates a
		new device dictionary from scratch before merging in the parameters
		from dict. The contents of this dictionary are
		implementationdependent.</p>
	<p>If a device's BeginPage or EndPage procedure invokes
		setpagedevice, an undefined error occurs.</p>
