	<h3>setcachelimit</h3>
	<pre>int <b>setcachelimit</b> -</pre>
	<p>establishes the maximum number of bytes the pixel array (bitmap)
		of a single cached glyph may occupy. Any glyph larger than this
		(according to the glyph bounding box information passed to
		setcachedevice) is not saved in the font cache. Instead, its
		description is executed every time the glyph is encountered.
		setcachelimit affects the decision whether to place new glyphs in the
		font cache; it does not disturb any glyphs already in the cache.
		Making the limit larger allows larger glyphs to be cached, but may
		decrease the total number of different glyphs that can be held in the
		cache simultaneously. Changing this parameter is appropriate only in
		very unusual situations.</p>
	<p>The maximum limit for int is implementation-dependent,
		representing the total available size of the font cache (see
		cachestatus). As a practical matter, int should not be larger than a
		small fraction of the total font cache size. Modifications to the
		cache limit parameter are subject to save and restore. In an
		interpreter that supports multiple contexts, this parameter is
		maintained separately for each context.</p>
	<p>The parameter set by setcachelimit is the same as the
		MaxFontItem user parameter set by setuserparams (see Appendix C).</p>
