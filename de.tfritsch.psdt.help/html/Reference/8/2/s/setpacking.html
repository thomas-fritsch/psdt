	<pre>bool <b>setpacking</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		sets the array packing mode to <i>bool</i>. This determines the type
		of executable arrays subsequently created by the PostScript language
		scanner. The value <i>true</i> selects packed arrays; <i>false</i>
		selects ordinary arrays.
	</p>
	<p>
		The packing mode affects only the creation of procedures by the
		scanner when it encounters program text bracketed by { and } during
		interpretation of an executable file or string object, or during
		execution of the <a href="../t/token.html">token</a> operator. It does
		not affect the creation of literal arrays by the <a
			href="../@/bracketleft.html">[</a> and <a
			href="../@/bracketright.html">]</a> operators or by the array
		operator.
	</p>
	<p>
		Modifications to the array packing mode parameter are subject to <a
			href="save.html">save</a> and <a href="../r/restore.html">restore</a>.
		In an interpreter that supports multiple contexts, this parameter is
		maintained separately for each context.
	</p>

		<b>Example</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
systemdict /setpacking known
{ /savepacking currentpacking def
  true setpacking
}
if
<i>... Arbitrary procedure definitions ...</i>
systemdict /setpacking known
{savepacking setpacking}
if</pre>
	<p>This example illustrates how to use packed arrays in a way that
		is compatible with all LanguageLevels. If the packed array facility is
		available, the procedures represented by the arbitrary procedure
		definitions are defined as packed arrays; otherwise, they are defined
		as ordinary arrays. The example is careful to preserve the array
		packing mode in effect before its execution.</p>
