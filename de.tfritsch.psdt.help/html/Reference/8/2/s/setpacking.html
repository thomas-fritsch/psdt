	<h3>setpacking [LEVEL 2]</h3>
	<pre>bool <b>setpacking</b> -</pre>
	<p>sets the array packing mode to bool. This determines the type of
		executable arrays subsequently created by the PostScript language
		scanner. The value true selects packed arrays; false selects ordinary
		arrays.</p>
	<p>The packing mode affects only the creation of procedures by the
		scanner when it encounters program text bracketed by { and } during
		interpretation of an executable file or string object, or during
		execution of the token operator. It does not affect the creation of
		literal arrays by the [ and ] operators or by the array operator.
		Modifications to the array packing mode parameter are subject to save
		and restore. In an interpreter that supports multiple contexts, this
		parameter is maintained separately for each context.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
systemdict /setpacking known
{ /savepacking currentpacking def
  true setpacking
}
if
... Arbitrary procedure definitions ...
systemdict /setpacking known
{savepacking setpacking}
if</pre>
	<p>This example illustrates how to use packed arrays in a way that
		is compatible with all LanguageLevels. If the packed array facility is
		available, the procedures represented by the arbitrary procedure
		definitions are defined as packed arrays; otherwise, they are defined
		as ordinary arrays. The example is careful to preserve the array
		packing mode in effect before its execution.</p>
