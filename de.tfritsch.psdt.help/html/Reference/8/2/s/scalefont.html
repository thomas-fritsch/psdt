	<p>
		applies the scale factor scale to font, producing a new font' whose
		characters are scaled by scale (in both x and y) when they are shown.
		scalefont first creates a copy of font, then replaces the new font's
		FontMatrix entry with the result of scaling the existing FontMatrix by
		scale. It inserts two additional entries, OrigFont and ScaleMatrix,
		whose purpose is internal to the implementation. Finally, it returns
		the result as font'. Showing characters from the transformed font
		produces the same results as showing from the original font after
		having scaled user space by the factor scale in both x and y by means
		of the <a href="scale.html">scale</a> operator.
	</p>
	<p>scalefont is essentially a convenience operator that enables the
		desired scale factor to be encapsulated in the font description.
		Another operator, makefont, performs more general transformations than
		simple scaling. See the description of makefont for more information
		on how the transformed font is derived. selectfont combines the
		effects of findfont and scalefont. The interpreter keeps track of font
		dictionaries recently created by scalefont.</p>
	<p>Calling scalefont multiple times with the same font and scale
		will usually return the same font' rather than create a new one each
		time. However, it is usually more efficient for a PostScript language
		program to apply scalefont only once for each font that it needs and
		to keep track of the resulting font dictionaries on its own.</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../m/makefont.html">makefont</a>, scalefont, and <a
			href="selectfont.html">selectfont</a> operators produce a font
		dictionary derived from an original font dictionary, but with the
		FontMatrix entry altered. The derived font dictionary is allocated in
		local or global VM according to whether the original font dictionary
		is in local or global VM. This is independent of the current VM
		allocation mode.

		<b>Example</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
/Helvetica findfont 12 scalefont setfont
</pre>
	<p>This obtains the standard Helvetica font, which is defined with
		a 1-unit line height, and scales it by a factor of 12 in both x and y
		dimensions. This produces a 12-unit high font (i.e., a 12-point font
		in default user space) whose characters have the same proportions as
		those in the original font.</p>
