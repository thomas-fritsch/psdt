	<b>startjob</b> LEVEL 2
	<pre>bool password <b>startjob</b> bool</pre>
	<p>conditionally starts a new job whose execution may alter the
		initial virtual memory for subsequent jobs (see Section 3.7.7, "Job
		Execution Environment"). bool1 specifies whether the new jobâ€™s side
		effects are to be persistent. The behavior of startjob depends on
		whether the following three conditions are true:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The current execution context supports job encapsulation-in
			other words, is under the control of a job server.</li>
		<li>The password is correct-in other words, matches the
			StartJobPassword system parameter.</li>
		<li>The current level of save nesting is not any deeper than it
			was at the time the current job started.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If all three conditions are satisfied, startjob performs the
		following actions:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Ends the current job&mdash;in other words, resets the stacks
			and, if the current job was encapsulated, performs a restore
			operation.</li>
		<li>Begins a new job. If bool1 is true, the usual save operation
			at the beginning of the job is omitted, enabling the new job to make
			persistent alterations to the initial VM. If bool1 is false, the
			usual save operation is performed, encapsulating the new job.</li>
		<li>Returns true on the operand stack.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If any of the three conditions is not satisfied, startjob pushes
		false on the operand stack and has no other effect.</p>
	<p>password is a string that authorizes switching between
		encapsulated and unencapsulated jobs, as well as between an ordinary
		encapsulated job and a system administrator job. If password is an
		integer, it is first converted to a string, as if by the cvs operator.
		It is compared to the StartJobPassword and SystemParamsPassword system
		parameters; see Section C.3.1, "Passwords," for details.</p>
