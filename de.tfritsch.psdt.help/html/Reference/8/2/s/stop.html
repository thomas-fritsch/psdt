	<h3>stop</h3>
	<pre>- <b>stop</b> -</pre>
	<p>terminates execution of the innermost, dynamically enclosing
		instance of a stopped context, without regard to lexical relationship.
		A stopped context is a procedure or other executable object invoked by
		the stopped operator. stop pops the execution stack down to the level
		of the stopped operator. The interpreter then pushes the boolean true
		on the operand stack and resumes execution at the next object in
		normal sequence after the stopped. It thus appears that stopped
		returned the value true, whereas it normally returns false.</p>
	<p>
		stop does not affect the operand or dictionary stacks. Any objects
		pushed on those stacks during the execution of the stopped context
		remain after the context is terminated. If stop is executed when there
		is no enclosing stopped context, the interpreter prints an error
		message and executes the built-in operator <a href="../q/quit.html">quit</a>.
		This never occurs during execution of ordinary user programs.
