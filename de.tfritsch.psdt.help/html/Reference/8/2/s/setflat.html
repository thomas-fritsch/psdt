	<pre>num <b>setflat</b> -</pre>
	<p>sets the flatness parameter in the graphics state to num, which
		must be a positive number. This parameter controls the precision with
		which curved path segments are rendered on the raster output device by
		operators such as stroke, fill, and clip. These operators render
		curves by approximating them with a series of straight line segments.
		Flatness is the error tolerance of this approximation; it is the
		maximum allowable distance of any point of the approximation from the
		corresponding point on the true curve, measured in output device
		pixels. The acceptable range of values is 0.2 to 100.0. If num is
		outside this range, the nearest valid value is substituted without
		error indication.</p>
	<p>The choice of a flatness value is a tradeoff between precision
		and execution efficiency. Very small values (less than 1 device pixel)
		produce very precise curves at high cost, because enormous numbers of
		tiny line segments must be generated. Larger values produce cruder
		approximations with substantially less computation. A default value of
		the flatness parameter is established by the device setup (Install)
		procedure for each raster output device. This value is based on the
		characteristics of the individual device and is suitable for most
		applications.</p>
	<p>setflat sets a graphics state parameter whose effect is
		device-dependent. It should not be used in a page description that is
		intended to be device-independent.</p>
