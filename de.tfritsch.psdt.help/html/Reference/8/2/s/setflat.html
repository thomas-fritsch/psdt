	<h3>setflat</h3>
	<pre>num <b>setflat</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		sets the flatness parameter in the graphics state to <i>num</i>, which
		must be a positive number. This parameter controls the precision with
		which curved path segments are rendered on the raster output device by
		operators such as <a href="stroke.html">stroke</a>, <a
			href="../f/fill.html">fill</a>, and <a href="../c/clip.html">clip</a>.
		These operators render curves by approximating them with a series of
		straight line segments. <i>Flatness</i> is the error tolerance of this
		approximation; it is the maximum allowable distance of any point of
		the approximation from the corresponding point on the true curve,
		measured in output device pixels. The acceptable range of values is
		0.2 to 100.0. If <i>num</i> is outside this range, the nearest valid
		value is substituted without error indication.

	<p>
		Figure 8.8 is exaggerated for emphasis. If the flatness parameter is
		large enough to cause visible straight line segments to appear, the
		result is unpredictable. The purpose of <b>setflat</b> is to control
		the precision of curve rendering, not to draw inscribed polygons.
	</p>
	<p>
		The choice of a flatness value is a tradeoff between precision and
		execution efficiency. Very small values (less than 1 device pixel)
		produce very precise curves at high cost, because enormous numbers of
		tiny line segments must be generated. Larger values produce cruder
		approximations with substantially less computation. A default value of
		the flatness parameter is established by the device setup (<b>Install</b>)
		procedure for each raster output device. This value is based on the
		characteristics of the individual device and is suitable for most
		applications.

	<p>
		<b>setflat</b> sets a graphics state parameter whose effect is
		device-dependent. It should not be used in a page description that is
		intended to be device-independent.
