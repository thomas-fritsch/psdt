	<p>The appropriate form of the operator depends on the current
		color space. All color spaces except Pattern use the first form, in
		which the operands comp1 through compn specify the values of the color
		components describing the desired color. The number of components and
		the valid ranges of their values depend on the specific
		characteristics of the color space; see Section 4.8, "Color Spaces."
		(In the case of an Indexed color space, the single operand comp1 is
		actually an index into the space's color table rather than a true
		color component.) If the wrong number of components is specified, an
		error will occur, such as stackunderflow or typecheck. If a component
		value is outside the valid range, the nearest valid value will be
		substituted without error indication.</p>
	<p>The second and third forms of setcolor are used when the current
		color space is a Pattern space. In both forms, the pattern operand is
		a pattern dictionary describing the pattern to be established as the
		current color. The values of the dictionary's PatternType and
		PaintType entries determine whether additional operands are needed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Shading patterns (PatternType 2) or colored tiling patterns
			(PatternType 1, PaintType 1) use the second form of the operator, in
			which the pattern dictionary is the only operand.</li>
		<li>Uncolored tiling patterns (PatternType 1, PaintType 2) use
			the third form, in which the dictionary is accompanied by one or more
			component values in the pattern's underlying color space, defining
			the color in which the pattern is to be painted.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The setcolorspace operator initializes the current color to a
		value that depends on the specific color space selected. Execution of
		this operator is not permitted in certain circumstances; see Section
		4.8.1, "Types of Color Space."</p>
