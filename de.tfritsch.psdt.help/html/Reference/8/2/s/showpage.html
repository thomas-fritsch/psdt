	<b>showpage</b>
	<pre>- <b>showpage</b> -</pre>
	<p>transmits the contents of the current page to the current output
		device, causing any marks painted on the page to be rendered on the
		output medium. showpage then erases the current page and reinitializes
		the graphics state in preparation for composing the next page. (The
		actions of showpage may be modified by the EndPage procedure, as
		discussed below.)</p>
	<p>Whether or not the current device is a page device, the precise
		manner in which the current page is transmitted is device-dependent.
		For certain devices (such as displays), no action is required, because
		the current page is visible while it is being composed.</p>
	<p>If the current device is a page device that was installed by
		setpagedevice (LanguageLevel 2), the precise behavior of showpage is
		determined by the values of parameters in the page device dictionary
		(see Sections 6.1.1, "Page Device Dictionary," and 6.2, "Page Device
		Parameters"). Parameters affecting the behavior of showpage include
		NumCopies, Collate, Duplex, and perhaps others as well.</p>
	<p>The main actions of showpage are as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Executes the EndPage procedure in the page device dictionary,
			passing an integer page count on the operand stack along with a
			reason code indicating that the procedure was called from showpage;
			see Section 6.2.6, "Device Initialization and Page Setup," for more
			information.</li>
		<li>If the boolean result returned by the EndPage procedure is
			true, transmits the pageâ€™s contents to the current output device and
			performs the equivalent of an erasepage operation, clearing the
			contents of raster memory in preparation for the next page. If the
			EndPage procedure returns false, showpage skips this step.</li>
		<li>Performs the equivalent of an initgraphics operation,
			reinitializing the graphics state for the next page.</li>
		<li>Executes the BeginPage procedure in the page device
			dictionary, passing an integer page count on the operand stack.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If the BeginPage or EndPage procedure invokes showpage, an
		undefined error occurs.</p>
	<p>For a device that produces output on a physical medium such as
		paper, showpage can optionally transmit multiple copies of the page in
		step 2 above. In Language- Level 2 or 3, the page device parameter
		NumCopies specifies the number of copies to be transmitted. In
		LanguageLevel 1 (or in higher LanguageLevels if NumCopies is null),
		the number of copies is given by the value associated with the name
		#copies in the naming environment defined by the current dictionary
		stack. (The default value of #copies is 1, defined in userdict.) For
		example, the code</p>
	<pre>
/#copies 5 def showpage
</pre>
	<p>prints five copies of the current page, then erases the current
		page and reinitializes the graphics state.</p>
