	<h3>showpage</h3>
	<pre>- <b>showpage</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		transmits the contents of the current page to the current output
		device, causing any marks painted on the page to be rendered on the
		output medium. <b>showpage</b> then erases the current page and
		reinitializes the graphics state in preparation for composing the next
		page. (The actions of <b>showpage</b> may be modified by the <b>EndPage</b>
		procedure, as discussed below.)
	</p>
	<p>
		If the current device is a page device that was installed by <b>setpagedevice</b>
		<i>(LanguageLevel 2)</i>, the precise behavior of <b>showpage</b> is
		determined by the values of parameters in the page device dictionary
		(see Sections <a href="../../../6/1/1.html">6.1.1, "Page Device
			Dictionary,"</a> and <a href="../../../6/2.html">6.2, "Page Device
			Parameters"</a>). Parameters affecting the behavior of <b>showpage</b>
		include <b>NumCopies</b>, <b>Collate</b>, <b>Duplex</b>, and perhaps
		others as well.
	</p>
	<p>Whether or not the current device is a page device, the precise
		manner in which the current page is transmitted is device-dependent.
		For certain devices (such as displays), no action is required, because
		the current page is visible while it is being composed.</p>
	<p>
		The main actions of <b>showpage</b> are as follows:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Executes the <b>EndPage</b> procedure in the page device
			dictionary, passing an integer page count on the operand stack along
			with a reason code indicating that the procedure was called from <b>showpage</b>;
			see Section <a href="../../../6/2/6.html">6.2.6, "Device
				Initialization and Page Setup,"</a> for more information.
		</li>
		<li>If the boolean result returned by the <b>EndPage</b>
			procedure is <i>true</i>, transmits the pageâ€™s contents to the
			current output device and performs the equivalent of an <a
			href="../e/erasepage.html">erasepage</a> operation, clearing the
			contents of raster memory in preparation for the next page. If the <b>EndPage</b>
			procedure returns <i>false</i>, <b>showpage</b> skips this step.
		</li>
		<li>Performs the equivalent of an initgraphics operation,
			reinitializing the graphics state for the next page.</li>
		<li>Executes the <b>BeginPage</b> procedure in the page device
			dictionary, passing an integer page count on the operand stack.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		If the <b>BeginPage</b> or <b>EndPage</b> procedure invokes <b>showpage</b>,
		an <a href="../u/undefined.html">undefined</a> error occurs.
	</p>
	<p>
		For a device that produces output on a physical medium such as paper,
		<b>showpage</b> can optionally transmit multiple copies of the page in
		step 2 above. In LanguageLevel 2 or 3, the page device parameter <b>NumCopies</b>
		specifies the number of copies to be transmitted. In LanguageLevel 1
		(or in higher LanguageLevels if <b>NumCopies</b> is <i>null</i>), the
		number of copies is given by the value associated with the name <b>#copies</b>
		in the naming environment defined by the current dictionary stack.
		(The default value of <b>#copies</b> is 1, defined in <a
			href="../u/userdict.html">userdict</a>.) For example, the code
	</p>
	<pre>
/#copies 5 def
showpage
</pre>
	<p>prints five copies of the current page, then erases the current
		page and reinitializes the graphics state.</p>
