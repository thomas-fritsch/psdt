	<h3>bind</h3>
	<pre>proc <b>bind</b> proc</pre>
	<p>
		replaces executable operator names in <i>proc</i> by their values. For
		each element of <i>proc</i> that is an executable name, <b>bind</b>
		looks up the name in the context of the current dictionary stack as if
		by the <a href="../l/load.html">load</a> operator. If the name is
		found and its value is an operator object, <b>bind</b> replaces the
		name with the operator in <b>proc</b>. If the name is not found or its
		value is not an operator, <b>bind</b> does not make a change.
	</p>
	<p>
		For each procedure object contained within <i>proc</i>, <b>bind</b>
		applies itself recursively to that procedure, makes the procedure
		read-only, and stores it back into <i>proc</i>. <b>bind</b> applies to
		both arrays and packed arrays, but it treats their access attributes
		differently. It will ignore a read-only array; that is, it will
		neither bind elements of the array nor examine nested procedures. On
		the other hand, <b>bind</b> will operate on a packed array (which
		always has read-only or even more restricted access), disregarding its
		access attribute. No error occurs in either case.
	</p>
	<p>
		The effect of <b>bind</b> is that all operator names in <i>proc</i>
		and in procedures nested within <i>proc</i> to any depth become
		tightly bound to the operators themselves. During subsequent execution
		of <i>proc</i>, the interpreter encounters the operators themselves
		rather than their names. See Section <a href="../../../3.12.html">3.12,
			"Early Name Binding."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 3, if the user parameter <b>IdiomRecognition</b> is
		true, then after replacing executable names with operators, <b>bind</b>
		compares <i>proc</i> with every template procedure defined in
		instances of the <a href="../../../3/9/2.html#IdiomSet">IdiomSet</a>
		resource category. If it finds a match, it returns the associated
		substitute procedure. See Section <a href="../../../3/12/1.html">3.12.1,
			"bind Operator."</a>
