	<p>
		replaces executable operator names in proc by their values. For each
		element of proc that is an executable name, bind looks up the name in
		the context of the current dictionary stack as if by <a
			href="../l/load.html">load</a>. If the name is found and its value is
		an operator object, bind replaces the name by the operator in proc. If
		the name is not found or its value is not an operator, bind does not
		make a change.
	</p>
	<p>For each procedure object in proc, bind applies itself
		recursively to that procedure, makes the procedure read-only, and
		stores it back into proc. The bind operator applies to both arrays and
		packed arrays, but it treats their access attributes differently. It
		will ignore a read-only array; that is, it will neither bind elements
		of the array nor examine nested procedures. On the other hand, bind
		will operate on a packed array (which is always read-only),
		disregarding its access attribute. No error occurs in either case.</p>
	<p>The effect of bind is that all operator names in proc and in
		procedures nested in proc to any depth become &quot;tightly
		bound&quot; to the operators themselves. During subsequent execution
		of proc, the interpreter encounters the operators themselves rather
		than the names of operators.</p>
