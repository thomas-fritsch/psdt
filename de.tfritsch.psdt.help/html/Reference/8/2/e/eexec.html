	<b>eexec</b>
	<pre>  file <b>eexec</b> -
string <b>eexec</b> -</pre>
	<p>causes the contents of file (open for reading) or string to be
		decrypted and then executed in a manner similar to the exec operator.
		The decryption operation does not cause the file or string to be
		modified.</p>
	<p>eexec creates a new file object that serves as a decryption
		filter on the specified file or string. It pushes the new file object
		on the execution stack, making it the current file for the PostScript
		interpreter. Subsequently, each time the interpreter reads a character
		from this file, or a program reads explicitly from currentfile, the
		decryption filter reads one character from the original file or string
		and decrypts it.</p>
	<p>
		The decryption filter file is closed automatically when the end of the
		original file or string is encountered. It may also be closed
		explicitly by <a href="c.html#closefile">closefile</a>. If the file
		passed to eexec was <a href="c.html#currentfile">currentfile</a>, this
		resumes direct execution of that file with the decryption filter
		removed. The file may consist of encrypted text followed by
		unencrypted text if the last thing executed in the encrypted text is
		currentfile closefile.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before beginning execution, eexec pushes <a
			href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> on the dictionary stack.
		This ensures that the operators executed by the encrypted program have
		their standard meanings. When the decryption filter file is closed
		either explicitly or implicitly, the dictionary stack is popped. The
		program must be aware that it is being executed with <a
			href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> as the current dictionary;
		in particular, any definitions that it makes must be into a specific
		dictionary rather than the current one, since <a
			href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> is read-only.
	</p>
	<p>The encrypted file may be represented in either binary or hex;
		the eexec operator can decrypt it without being told which type it is.
		The recommended representation is hex, because hex data can be
		transmitted through communication channels that are not completely
		transparent. Regardless of the representation of the encrypted file,
		the encryption and decryption processes are transparent. That is, an
		arbitrary binary file can be encrypted, transmitted as either binary
		or hex, and decrypted to yield the original information.</p>
	<p>The encryption employed by eexec is intended primarily for use
		in Type 1 font programs. The book Adobe Type 1 Font Format contains a
		complete description of the encryption algorithm and recommended uses
		of eexec.</p>
