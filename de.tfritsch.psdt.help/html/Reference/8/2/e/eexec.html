	<h3>eexec</h3>
	<pre>  file <b>eexec</b> -
string <b>eexec</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		causes the contents of <i>file</i> (open for reading) or <i>string</i>
		to be decrypted and then executed in a manner similar to the <a
			href="exec.html">exec</a> operator. The decryption operation does not
		cause <i>file</i> or <i>string</i> to be modified.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>eexec</b> creates a new file object that serves as a decryption
		filter on <i>file</i> or <i>string</i>. It pushes the new file object
		on the execution stack, making it the current file for the PostScript
		interpreter. Subsequently, each time the interpreter reads a character
		from this file, or a program reads explicitly from the file returned
		by <a href="../c/currentfile.html">currentfile</a>, the decryption
		filter reads one character from the original <i>file</i> or <i>string</i>
		and decrypts it.
	</p>
	<p>
		The decryption filter file is closed automatically when the end of the
		original <i>file</i> or <i>string</i> is encountered, or it can be
		closed explicitly by <a href="../c/closefile.html">closefile</a>. If
		the file passed to <b>eexec</b> was the current file, this resumes
		direct execution of that file with the decryption filter removed. The
		file may consist of encrypted text followed by unencrypted text if the
		last thing executed in the encrypted text is currentfile closefile.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before beginning execution, <b>eexec</b> pushes <a
			href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> on the dictionary stack,
		thus ensuring that the operators executed by the encrypted program
		have their standard meanings. When the decryption filter file is
		closed either explicitly or implicitly, the dictionary stack is
		popped. The program must be aware that it is being executed with <a
			href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> as the current dictionary;
		in particular, any definitions that it makes must be into a specific
		dictionary rather than the current one, since <a
			href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> is read-only.
	</p>
	<p>The encrypted file may be represented in either binary or
		hexadecimal; eexec can decrypt it without being told which type it is.
		The recommended representation is hexadecimal, because hexadecimal
		data can be transmitted through communication channels that are not
		completely transparent. Regardless of the representation of the
		encrypted file, the encryption and decryption processes are
		transparent&mdash;that is, an arbitrary binary file can be encrypted,
		transmitted as either binary or hexadecimal, and decrypted to yield
		the original information.</p>
	<p>
		The encryption employed by <b>eexec</b> is intended primarily for use
		in Type 1 font programs. The book <i>Adobe Type 1 Font Format</i>
		contains a complete description of the encryption algorithm and
		recommended uses of <b>eexec</b>.
