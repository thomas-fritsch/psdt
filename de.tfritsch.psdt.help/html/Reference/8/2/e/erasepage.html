	<p>% different in the NeXT implementation</p>
	<p>This standard PostScript operator has the following effect in
		the NeXT implementation of the Display PostScript system: It erases
		the entire window to opaque white.</p>
	<p>erases the entire current page by painting it with gray level 1,
		which is ordinarily white, but may be some other color if an atypical
		transfer function has been defined. The entire page is erased,
		regardless of the clip path currently in force. erasepage affects only
		the contents of raster memory. It does not modify the graphics state
		nor does it cause a page to be transmitted to the output device.</p>
	<p>
		erasepage is executed automatically by <a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a>
		after imaging. There are few situations in which a PostScript language
		page description should execute erasepage explicitly, because the
		operator affects portions of the current page outside the current clip
		path. It is usually more appropriate to erase just the inside of the
		current clip path (see <a href="../c/clippath.html">clippath</a>).
		Then the page description can be embedded within another, composite
		page without undesirable effects.
