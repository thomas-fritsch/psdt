	<h3>erasepage</h3>
	<pre>- <b>erasepage</b> -</pre>
	<p>% different in the NeXT implementation</p>
	<p>This standard PostScript operator has the following effect in
		the NeXT implementation of the Display PostScript system: It erases
		the entire window to opaque white.</p>
	<p>
		erases the current page by painting it with gray level 1.0 (which is
		ordinarily white, but may be some other color if an atypical transfer
		function has been defined). The entire page is erased, without
		reference to the clipping path currently in force. <b>erasepage</b>
		affects only the contents of raster memory; it does not modify the
		graphics state, nor does it cause a page to be transmitted to the
		output device.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a> operator automatically
		invokes <b>erasepage</b> after imaging a page. There are few
		situations in which a PostScript page description should invoke <b>erasepage</b>
		explicitly, since it affects portions of the page outside the current
		clipping path. It is usually more appropriate to erase just the area
		inside the current clipping path (see <a href="../c/cippath.html">clippath</a>).
		This allows the page description to be embedded within another,
		composite page without undesirable effects.
