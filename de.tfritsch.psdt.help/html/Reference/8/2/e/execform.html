	<pre>form <b>execform</b> -</pre>
	<p>paints a form specified by a form dictionary. The graphical
		output produced by execform is defined by the form dictionary's
		PaintProc procedure.</p>
	<p>If this is the first invocation of execform for form, execform
		first verifies that the dictionary contains the required entries. Then
		it adds an entry to the dictionary with the key Implementation, whose
		value is private to the implementation. Finally, it makes the
		dictionary read-only. (execform performs these alterations directly to
		the operand dictionary; it does not copy the dictionary.)</p>
	<p>When execform needs to call the PaintProc procedure, it pushes
		the form dictionary on the operand stack, then executes the equivalent
		of</p>
	<pre>
gsave                          % Operand stack: dict
  dup /Matrix get concat
  dup /BBox get aload pop      % Stack: dict llx lly urx ury
  exch 3 index sub
  exch 2 index sub             % Stack: dict llx lly width height
  rectclip                     % Also does a newpath
  dup /PaintProc get           % Stack: dict proc
  exec                         % Execute PaintProc with dict on stack
grestore
</pre>
	<p>The PaintProc procedure is expected to consume the dictionary
		operand and to execute a sequence of graphics operators to paint the
		form. The PaintProc must always produce the same output, given the
		same graphics state parameters, independent of the number of times it
		is called and independent, for example, of the contents of userdict.
		The PostScript language program should not expect any particular
		execution of execform to cause execution of the specified PaintProc.</p>
	<p>The documented errors are those produced directly by execform.
		Obviously, the PaintProc can cause other errors.</p>
