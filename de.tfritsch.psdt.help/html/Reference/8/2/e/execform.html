	<pre>form <b>execform</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		paints a form defined by a form dictionary constructed as described in
		Section <a href="../../../4/7.html">4.7, "Forms."</a> The graphical
		output produced by execform is defined by the form dictionary's <b>PaintProc</b>
		procedure.
	</p>
	<p>
		If this is the first invocation of <b>execform</b> for form, <b>execform</b>
		first verifies that the dictionary contains the required entries. Then
		it adds an entry to the dictionary with the key <i>Implementation</i>,
		whose value is private to the PostScript interpreter. Finally, it
		makes the dictionary read-only. (<b>execform</b> performs these
		alterations directly to the operand dictionary; it does not copy the
		dictionary. These actions succeed even if the dictionary is already
		read-only.)
	</p>
	<p>
		When <b>execform</b> needs to call the <b>PaintProc</b> procedure, it
		pushes the form dictionary on the operand stack, then executes the
		equivalent of the following code:
	</p>
	<pre>
gsave                          % Operand stack: dict
  dup /Matrix get concat
  dup /BBox get aload pop      % Stack: dict llx lly urx ury
  exch 3 index sub
  exch 2 index sub             % Stack: dict llx lly width height
  rectclip                     % Also does a newpath
  dup /PaintProc get           % Stack: dict proc
  exec                         % Execute PaintProc with dict on stack
grestore
</pre>
	<p>
		The <b>PaintProc</b> procedure is expected to consume the dictionary
		operand and to execute a sequence of graphics operators to paint the
		form. The <b>PaintProc</b> procedure must always produce the same
		output given the same graphics state parameters, independently of the
		number of times it is called and independently, for example, of the
		contents of <a href="../u/userdict.html">userdict</a>. The PostScript
		program should not expect any particular invocation of <b>execform</b>
		to cause the specified PaintProc procedure to be executed.
	</p>
	<p>
		The errors listed below are those produced directly by <b>execform</b>.
		The <b>PaintProc</b> procedure can, of course, cause other errors.
