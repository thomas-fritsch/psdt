	<h3>exec</h3>
	<pre>any <b>exec</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		pushes the operand on the execution stack, executing it immediately.
		The effect of executing an object depends on the object's type and
		literal/executable attribute; see Section <a href="../../../3/5.html">3.5,
			"Execution."</a> In particular, executing a literal object will cause it
		only to be pushed back on the operand stack. Executing a procedure,
		however, will cause the procedure to be called.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
(3 2 add) cvx exec  &rArr;  5
3 2 /add exec       &rArr;  3 2 /add
3 2 /add cvx exec   &rArr;  5
</pre>
	<p>In the first example, the string 3 2 add is made executable and
		then executed. Executing a string causes its characters to be scanned
		and interpreted according to the PostScript language syntax rules.</p>
	<p>
		In the second example, the literal objects 3, 2, and /add are pushed
		on the operand stack, then <b>exec</b> is applied to /add. Since /add
		is a literal name, executing it simply causes it to be pushed back on
		the operand stack. The <b>exec</b> operator in this case has no useful
		effect.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the third example, the literal name /add on the top of the operand
		stack is made executable by <a href="../c/cvx.html">cvx</a>. Applying
		<b>exec</b> to this executable name causes it to be looked up and the
		<b>add</b> operation to be performed.
