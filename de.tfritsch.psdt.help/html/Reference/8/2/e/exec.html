	<h3>exec</h3>
	<pre>any <b>exec</b> -</pre>
	<p>pushes the operand on the execution stack, executing it
		immediately. The effect of executing an object depends on the object's
		type and literal/executable attribute. In particular, executing a
		literal object will cause it only to be pushed back on the operand
		stack. Executing a procedure, however, will cause the procedure to be
		called.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
(3 2 add) cvx exec  &rArr;  5
3 2 /add exec       &rArr;  3 2 /add
3 2 /add cvx exec   &rArr;  5
</pre>
	<p>In the first line, the string (3 2 add) is made executable and
		then executed. Executing a string causes its characters to be scanned
		and interpreted according to the PostScript language syntax rules.</p>
	<p>In the second line, the literal objects 3, 2, and /add are
		pushed on the operand stack, then exec is applied to the add. Since
		the add is a literal name, executing it simply causes it to be pushed
		back on the operand stack. The exec in this case has no useful effect.</p>
	<p>
		In the third line, the literal name /add on the top of the operand
		stack is made executable by <a href="../c/cvx.html">cvx</a>. Applying
		exec to this executable name causes it to be looked up and the add
		operation to be performed.
