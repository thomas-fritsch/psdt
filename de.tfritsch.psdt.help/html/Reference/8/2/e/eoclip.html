	<h3>eoclip</h3>
	<pre>- <b>eoclip</b> -</pre>
	<p>intersects the inside of the current clipping path with the
		inside of the current path to produce a new, smaller current clipping
		path. The inside of the current path is determined by the even-odd
		rule, while the inside of the current clipping path is determined by
		whatever rule was used at the time that path was created.</p>
	<p>
		Except for the choice of insideness rule, the behavior of eoclip is
		identical to that of <a href="../c/clip.html">clip</a>.
