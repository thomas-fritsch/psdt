	<h3>eoclip</h3>
	<pre>- <b>eoclip</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		intersects the area inside the current clipping path with the area
		inside the current path to produce a new, smaller clipping path. The
		even-odd rule (see <a href="../../../4/5/2/2.html">"Even-Odd Rule"
			on page 196</a>) is used to determine what points lie inside the current
		path, while the inside of the current clipping path is determined by
		whatever rule was used at the time the path was created. In all other
		respects, the behavior of <b>eoclip</b> is identical to that of <a
			href="../c/clip.html">clip</a>.
