	<p>resets the current graphics state from the one on the top of the
		graphics state stack and pops the graphics state stack, restoring the
		graphics state in effect at the time of the matching gsave. This
		operator provides a simple way to undo complicated transformations and
		other graphics state modifications without having to re-establish all
		graphics state parameters individually.</p>
	<p>
		If there is no matching <a href="gsave.html">gsave</a> or if the most
		recent <a href="gsave.html">gsave</a> preceded the most recent
		unmatched save, grestore does not pop the graphics state stack,
		although it does restore the graphics state from the top of the
		graphics state stack.
