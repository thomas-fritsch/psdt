	<h3>grestore</h3>
	<pre>- <b>grestore</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		resets the current graphics state from the one on the top of the
		graphics state stack and pops the graphics state stack, restoring the
		graphics state in effect at the time of the matching <b>gsave</b>
		operation. This operator provides a simple way to undo complicated
		transformations and other graphics state modifications without having
		to reestablish all graphics state parameters individually.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the topmost graphics state on the stack was saved with <a
			href="../s/save.html">save</a> rather than <a href="gsave.html">gsave</a>
		(that is, if there has been no <a href="gsave.html">gsave</a>
		operation since the most recent unmatched save), <b>grestore</b>
		restores that topmost graphics state without popping it from the
		stack. If there is no unmatched <a href="../s/save.html">save</a>
		(which can happen only during an unencapsulated job) and the graphics
		state stack is empty, <b>grestore</b> has no effect.
