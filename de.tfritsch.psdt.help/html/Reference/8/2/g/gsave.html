	<h3>gsave</h3>
	<pre>- <b>gsave</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		pushes a copy of the current graphics state on the graphics state
		stack. All elements of the graphics state are saved, including the
		CTM, current path, clip path, and identity of the raster output
		device, but not the contents of raster memory. The saved state may
		later be restored by a matching <a href="grestore.html">grestore</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The save operator implicitly performs a gsave, but restoring a
		graphics state saved by save is slightly different from restoring one
		saved by gsave (see the descriptions of <a href="grestore.html">grestore</a>
		and <a href="grestoreall.html">grestoreall</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that, unlike <a href="../s/save.html">save</a>, gsave does not
		return a save object on the operand stack to represent the saved
		state. gsave and <a href="grestore.html">grestore</a> work strictly in
		a stack-like fashion, except for the wholesale restoration performed
		by <a href="../r/restore.html">restore</a> and <a
			href="grestoreall.html">grestoreall</a>.
