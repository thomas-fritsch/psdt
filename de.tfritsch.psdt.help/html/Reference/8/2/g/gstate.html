	<h3>gstate [LEVEL 2]</h3>
	<pre>- <b>gstate</b> gstate</pre>
	<p>creates a new gstate (graphics state) object and pushes it on
		the operand stack. Its initial value is a copy of the current graphics
		state.</p>
	<p>This operator consumes VM; it is the only graphics state
		operator that does. The gstate is allocated in either local or global
		VM according to the current VM allocation mode.</p>
	<p>If gstate is allocated in global VM, gstate will generate an
		invalidaccess error if any of the composite objects in the current
		graphics state are in local VM. Such objects might include the current
		font, screen function, halftone dictionary, transfer function, or dash
		pattern. In general, allocating gstate objects in global VM is risky
		and should be avoided.</p>
