	<h3>grestoreall</h3>
	<pre>- <b>grestoreall</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		repeatedly performs <a href="grestore.html">grestore</a> operations
		until it encounters a graphics state that was saved by a <a
			href="../s/save.html">save</a> operation (as opposed to <a
			href="gsave.html">gsave</a>), leaving that state on the top of the
		graphics state stack and resetting the current graphics state from it.
		If no such graphics state is encountered (which can happen only during
		an unencapsulated job), the current graphics state is reset to the
		bottommost state on the stack and the stack is cleared to empty. If
		the graphics state stack is empty, <b>grestoreall</b> has no effect.
