	<b>glyphshow</b> LEVEL 2
	<pre>name <b>glyphshow</b> -</pre>
	<p>shows a single character, identified by name, from the current
		font. Unlike all other show variants, glyphshow bypasses the current
		font's Encoding. It can access any character in the font, whether or
		not that character's name is present in the font's encoding vector.</p>
	<p>The behavior of glyphshow depends on the current font's
		FontType. For FontType 1, glyphshow looks up name in the font's
		CharStrings dictionary to obtain a character description to execute.
		If name is not present in the CharStrings dictionary, glyphshow
		substitutes the .notdef entry, which must be present in every Type 1
		font.</p>
	<p>
		For FontType 3, if the font dictionary contains a BuildGlyph
		procedure, glyphshow pushes the current font dictionary and name on
		the operand stack, then invokes BuildGlyph in the usual way . If there
		is no BuildGlyph procedure, but only a BuildChar procedure, glyphshow
		searches the font's Encoding array for an occurrence of name. If it
		finds one, it pushes the font dictionary and the array index on the
		operand stack, then invokes BuildChar in the usual way. If name is not
		present in the encoding, glyphshow substitutes the name .notdef and
		repeats the search. If .notdef isn't present either, an <a
			href="../i/invalidfont.html">invalidfont</a> error occurs.
	</p>
	<p>Like show, glyphshow can access characters that are already in
		the font cache. glyphshow does not always need to execute the
		character's description.</p>
	<p>
		glyphshow operates only with base fonts. If the current font is
		composite (FontType 0), an <a href="../i/invalidfont.html">invalidfont</a>
		error occurs.
