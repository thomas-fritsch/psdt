	<h3>==</h3>
	<pre>any <b>==</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		pops an object from the operand stack, produces a text representation
		of that object followed by a newline character, and writes the result
		to the standard output file. <b>==</b> attempts to produce a result
		that resembles the PostScript syntax for creating the object. It
		precedes literal names by /, brackets strings with (...), and expands
		the values of arrays and packed arrays and brackets them with [...] or
		{...}. For an object with no printable representation, <b>==</b>
		produces the name of its type in the form -mark- or -dict-. For an
		operator object, it produces the operator's name in the form
		--operator--, such as --add--.
	</p>
	<p>
		The name <b>==</b> is not special. In PostScript language programs it
		must be delimited by white space or special characters the same as
		names composed of alphabetical characters. The value of <b>==</b> is
		not an operator, but rather a built-in procedure.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>==</b> operator is intended for convenience in debugging. The
		details of how <b>==</b> formats its output are intentionally
		unspecified. A program requiring detailed control over output format
		should do its own formatting explicitly, using lower-level operators,
		such as <a href="../c/cvs.html">cvs</a>. Also, the LanguageLevel 2
		operators <a href="../p/printobject.html">printobject</a> and <a
			href="../w/writeobject.html">writeobject</a> may be more suitable for
		generating machine-readable output.
