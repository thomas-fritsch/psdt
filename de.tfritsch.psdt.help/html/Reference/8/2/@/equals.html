	<b>=</b>
	<pre>any <b>=</b> -</pre>
	<p>pops an object from the operand stack, produces a text
		representation of that object's value, and writes the result followed
		by a newline character to the standard output file. The text is that
		produced by the cvs operator; thus, = prints the value of a number,
		boolean, string, name, or operator object and prints --nostringval--
		for an object of any other type.</p>
	<p>The name = is not special. In PostScript language programs it
		must be delimited by white space or special characters the same as
		names composed of alphabetical characters. The value of = is not an
		operator, but rather a built-in procedure.</p>
