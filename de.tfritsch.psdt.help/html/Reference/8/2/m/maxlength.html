	<h3>maxlength</h3>
	<pre>dict <b>maxlength</b> int</pre>
	<p>
		returns the capacity of dict-in other words, the maximum number of
		key-value pairs that dict can hold using the VM currently allocated to
		it. In Level 1 implementations, maxlength returns the length operand
		of the dict operator that created the dictionary; this is the
		dictionary's maximum capacity (exceeding it causes a <a
			href="../d/dictfull.html">dictfull</a> error). In a Level 2
		implementation, which permits a dictionary to grow beyond its initial
		capacity, maxlength returns its current capacity, a number at least as
		large as that returned by length.
