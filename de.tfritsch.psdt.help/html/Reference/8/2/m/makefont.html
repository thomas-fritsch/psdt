	<b>makefont</b>
	<pre>font matrix <b>makefont</b> font'</pre>
	<p>applies matrix to font, producing a new font' whose characters
		are transformed by matrix when they are shown. makefont first creates
		a copy of font. Then it replaces the new font's FontMatrix entry with
		the result of concatenating the existing FontMatrix with matrix. It
		inserts two additional entries, OrigFont and ScaleMatrix, whose
		purpose is internal to the implementation. Finally, it returns the
		result as font'.</p>
	<p>
		The makefont, <a href="../s/scalefont.html">scalefont</a>, and <a
			href="../s/selectfont.html">selectfont</a> operators produce a font
		dictionary derived from an original font dictionary, but with the
		FontMatrix entry altered. The derived font dictionary is allocated in
		local or global VM according to whether the original font dictionary
		is in local or global VM. This is independent of the current VM
		allocation mode.
	</p>
	<p>Normally, makefont copies only the font dictionary. Subsidiary
		objects, such as the CharStrings and FontInfo dictionaries, are shared
		with the original font. However, if font is a composite font, makefont
		also copies the font dictionaries of any descendant composite fonts.
		It does not copy descendant base fonts.</p>
	<p>
		Showing characters from the transformed font produces the same results
		as showing from the original font after having transformed user space
		by the same matrix. makefont is essentially a convenience operator
		that permits the desired transformation to be encapsulated in the font
		description. The most common transformation is to scale a font by a
		uniform factor in both x and y. scalefont is a special case of the
		more general makefont and should be used for such uniform scaling.
		Another operator, <a href="../s/selectfont.html">selectfont</a>,
		combines the effects of <a href="../f/findfont.html">findfont</a> and
		makefont.
	</p>
	<p>The interpreter keeps track of font dictionaries recently
		created by makefont. Calling makefont multiple times with the same
		font and matrix will usually return the same font' rather than create
		a new one. However, it is usually more efficient for a PostScript
		language program to apply makefont only once for each font that it
		needs and to keep track of the resulting font dictionaries on its own.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
/Helvetica findfont [10 0 0 12 0 0] makefont setfont
</pre>
	<p>This obtains the standard Helvetica font, which is defined with
		a one unit line height, and scales it by a factor of 10 in the x
		dimension and 12 in the y dimension. This produces a 12-unit high font
		(i.e., a 12-point font in default user space) whose characters are
		&quot;condensed&quot; in the x dimension by a ratio of 10/12.</p>
