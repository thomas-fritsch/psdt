	<pre>- <b>mark</b> mark</pre>
	<p>pushes a mark (an object whose type is mark, not the mark
		operator itself) on the operand stack. All marks are identical, and
		the operand stack may contain any number of them at once.
	<p>
		The primary use of marks is to indicate the stack position of the
		beginning of an indefinitely long list of operands being passed to an
		operator or procedure. The <a href="../@/bracketright.html">]</a>
		operator (array construction) is the most common operator that works
		this way. It treats as operands all elements of the stack down to a
		mark that was pushed by the <a href="../@/bracketleft.html">[ </a>operator
		( <a href="../@/bracketleft.html">[</a> is a synonym for mark). It is
		possible to define procedures that work similarly. Operators such as
		counttomark and cleartomark are useful within such procedures.
