	<h3>quit</h3>
	<pre>- <b>quit</b>> -</pre>
	<p>terminates operation of the interpreter. The precise action of
		quit depends on the environment in which the PostScript interpreter is
		running. It may give control to an operating system command
		interpreter, halt or restart the machine, and so on.</p>
	<p>
		In an interpreter that supports multiple execution contexts, the quit
		operator causes termination of the current context only. Termination
		is immediate, even if the context was created by <a
			href="../f/fork.html">fork</a> in the expectation of a subsequent <a
			href="../j/join.html">join</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a context that is under the control of a job server, the definition
		of the quit operator in <a href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>
		is masked by another definition of quit in <a
			href="../u/userdict.html">userdict</a>, which usually is searched
		before <a href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>. The default
		definition of quit in <a href="../u/userdict.html">userdict</a> is the
		same as <a href="../s/stop.html">stop</a>, which terminates the
		current job, but not the interpreter as a whole. The quit operator in
		<a href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> can be executed only by
		an unencapsulated job; in an encapsulated job, it causes an <a
			href="../i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a> error.
