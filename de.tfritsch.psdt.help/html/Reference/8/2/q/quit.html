	<h3>quit</h3>
	<pre>- <b>quit</b>> -</pre>
	<p>
		terminates operation of the PostScript interpreter. The precise action
		of <b>quit</b> depends on the environment in which the interpreter is
		running. It may, for example, give control to an operating system
		command interpreter, or halt or restart the machine.
	</p>
	<p>
		In an interpreter that supports multiple execution contexts, the <b>quit</b>
		operator causes termination of the current context only. Termination
		is immediate, even if the context was created by <a
			href="../f/fork.html">fork</a> in the expectation of a subsequent <a
			href="../j/join.html">join</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a context that is under the control of a job server (see Section <a
			href="../../../3/7/7.html">3.7.7, "Job Execution Environment"</a>),
		the definition of the <b>quit</b> operator in <a
			href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> is masked by another
		definition of <b>quit</b> in <a href="../u/userdict.html">userdict</a>,
		which usually is searched before <a href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>.
		The default definition of quit in <a href="../u/userdict.html">userdict</a>
		is the same as <a href="../s/stop.html">stop</a>, which terminates the
		current job, but not the interpreter as a whole. The <b>quit</b>
		operator in <a href="../s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> can be
		executed only by an unencapsulated job; in an encapsulated job, it
		causes an <a href="../i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a> error.
