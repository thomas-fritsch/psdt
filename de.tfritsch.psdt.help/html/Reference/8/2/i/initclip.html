	<p>
		replaces the current clip path parameter in the graphics state by the
		default clip path for the current output device. This path usually
		corresponds to the boundary of the maximum imageable area for the
		current output device. For a pageoriented output device, its
		dimensions are those established by the setpagedevice operator. For a
		display device, the clipping region established by initclip is not
		well defined. Display PostScript applications should not make the
		assumption that the clipping region corresponds to the window boundary
		(see <a href="../v/viewclippath.html">viewclippath</a>).
	</p>
	<p>There are few situations in which a PostScript language program
		should execute initclip explicitly. A page description that executes
		initclip usually produces incorrect results if it is embedded within
		another, composite page.</p>
