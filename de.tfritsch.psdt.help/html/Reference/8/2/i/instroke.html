	<pre>     x y <b>instroke</b> bool
userpath <b>instroke</b> bool</pre>
	<p>tests whether the area that would be painted by stroking the
		current path with the stroke operator includes a specified point or
		intersects a specified region. The operation does not actually place
		any marks on the current page, nor does it disturb the current path in
		the graphics state.</p>
	<p>
		The first form of the operator returns true if the device pixel
		containing the point at coordinates (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) in user space
		would be painted by applying the stroke operator to the current path.
		The second form returns <i>true</i> if any of the pixels enclosed by <i>userpath</i>
		would be painted. If the stated conditions are not met, both forms
		return <i>false</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In computing the shape of the stroke, <b>instroke</b> takes into
		account all current stroke-related parameters in the graphics state:
		line width, line cap, line join, miter limit, dash pattern, and stroke
		adjustment. (If the current line width is 0, the set of pixels
		considered to be part of the stroke is device-dependent.) However, the
		operator ignores the current clipping path; that is, it returns <i>true</i>
		for any pixel that lies within the computed stroke, even if the <a
			href="../s/stroke.html">stroke</a> operator would not actually mark
		that pixel because it lies outside the clipping path.
