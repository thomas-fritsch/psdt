	<h3>instroke [LEVEL 2]</h3>
	<pre>     x y <b>instroke</b> bool
userpath <b>instroke</b> bool</pre>
	<p>The first form returns true if the device pixel containing the
		point (x, y) in user space would be painted by a stroke of the current
		path in the graphics state. Otherwise, it returns false. It does not
		place any marks on the current page nor does it disturb the current
		path.</p>
	<p>In the second form of the operator, the device pixels that would
		be painted by filling userpath become an &quot;aperture.&quot;
		instroke returns true if any of the pixels in the aperture would be
		painted by a stroke of the current path in the graphics state.
		Otherwise, it returns false.</p>
	<p>As with infill, this operator ignores the current clipping path
		and current view clip; that is, it detects a &quot;hit&quot; on any
		pixel that lies beneath a stroke drawn along the current path, even if
		stroking that path would not mark the current page due to clipping.</p>
	<p>The shape against which the point (x, y) or the aperture,
		userpath, is tested is computed according to the current,
		stroke-related parameters in the graphics state: line width, line cap,
		line join, miter limit, dash pattern, and stroke adjust. If the
		current line width is zero, the set of pixels considered to be part of
		the stroke is device dependent.</p>
