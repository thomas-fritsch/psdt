	<p>
		paints a sampled image onto the current page. This description only
		summarizes the general behavior of the image operator; see Section <a
			href="../../../4/10.html">4.10, "Images,"</a> for full details.
	</p>
	<p>
		The image is a rectangular array of <i>width</i> &times; <i>height</i>
		sample values, each consisting of <i>bits/sample</i> bits of data.
		Valid values of <i>bits/sample</i> are 1, 2, 4, 8, or 12. The data is
		received as a sequence of characters&mdash;that is, 8-bit integers in
		the range 0 to 255. If <i>bits/sample</i> is less than 8, sample
		values are packed from left to right within a character (see Section <a
			href="../../../4/10/2.html">4.10.2, "Sample Representation"</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		The image is considered to exist in its own coordinate system, or <i>image</i>
		space. The rectangular boundary of the image has its lower-left corner
		at coordinates (0, 0) and its upper-right corner at (<i>width</i>, <i>height</i>).
		The matrix operand defines a transformation from user space to image
		space.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the first form of the operator, the parameters are specified as
		separate operands. This form always renders a monochrome image
		according to the <b>DeviceGray</b> color space, regardless of the
		current color space in the graphics state. This is the only form
		supported in LanguageLevel 1.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the second form <i>(LanguageLevel 2)</i>, the parameters are
		contained as entries in an image dictionary <i>dict</i>, which is
		supplied as the single operand. This form renders either a monochrome
		or a color image, according to the current color space. The number of
		component values per source sample and the interpretation of those
		values depend on the color space.
	</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 1, <i>datasrc</i> must be a procedure. In
		LanguageLevel 2 or 3, it may be any data source&mdash;a procedure, a
		string, or a readable file, including a filtered file (see Section <a
			href="../../../3/13.html">3.13, "Filtered Files Details"</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		If <i>datasrc</i> is a procedure, it is executed repeatedly to obtain
		the actual image data. <i>datasrc</i> must return a string on the
		operand stack containing any number of additional characters of sample
		data. The sample values are assumed to be received in a fixed order:
		(0, 0) to (<i>width</i> - 1, 0), then (0, 1) to (<i>width</i> - 1, 1),
		and so on. If <i>datasrc</i> returns a string of length 0, image will
		terminate execution prematurely.
	</p>
	<p>
		Execution of this operator is not permitted in certain circumstances;
		see Section <a href="../../../4/8/1.html">4.8.1, "Types of Color
			Space."</a>
