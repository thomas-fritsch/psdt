	<p>paints a sampled image onto the current page. The description
		here only summarizes the image operator.</p>
	<p>The sampled image is a rectangular array of width x height
		sample values, each of which consists of bits/sample bits of data (1,
		2, 4, 8, or 12). The data is received as a sequence of characters-in
		other words, 8-bit integers in the range 0 to 255. If bits/sample is
		less than 8, sample values are packed left to right within a character</p>
	<p>In the first form of image, the parameters are specified as
		separate operands. This is the only form Level 1 implementations
		support. image renders a monochrome image according to the DeviceGray
		color space, regardless of the current color space.</p>
	<p>In the second form, the parameters are contained as key-value
		pairs in an image dictionary, which is specified as the single operand
		of image. This form is a Level 2 feature. image renders either a
		monochrome or color image according to the current color space
		parameter in the graphics state. The number of component values per
		source sample and the interpretations of those values depend on the
		current color space.</p>
	<p>The image is considered to exist in its own coordinate system.
		The rectangular boundary of the image has its lower-left corner at (0,
		0) and its upper-right corner at (width, height). The matrix operand
		specifies a transformation from user space to the image coordinate
		system.</p>
	<p>In Level 1, datasrc must be a procedure. In Level 2, datasrc may
		be any data source &mdash;a procedure, string, or readable file object
		(including a filtered file).</p>
	<p>If datasrc is a procedure, image executes datasrc repeatedly to
		obtain the actual image data. datasrc must return (on the operand
		stack) a string containing any number of additional characters of
		sample data.</p>
	<p>If datasrc returns a string of length zero, image will terminate
		execution prematurely. The sample values are assumed to be received in
		a fixed order: (0, 0) through (width-1, 0), then (0, 1) through
		(width-1, 1), and so on.</p>
	<p>Execution of this operator is not permitted in certain
		circumstances.</p>
