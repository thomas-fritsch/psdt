	<h3>invalidrestore (error)</h3>
	<p>
		An improper <a href="../r/restore.html">restore</a> operation has been
		attempted. One or more of the operand, dictionary, and execution
		stacks contain composite objects whose values were created more
		recently than the <a href="../s/save.html">save</a> operation whose
		context is being restored. Since <a href="../r/restore.html">restore</a>
		would destroy those values, but the stacks are unaffected by <a
			href="../r/restore.html">restore</a>, the outcome would be <a
			href="../u/undefined.html">undefined</a> and cannot be allowed.
