	<b>invalidrestore</b> (error)
	<p>
		An improper restore has been attempted. One or more of the operand,
		dictionary, or execution stacks contains composite objects whose
		values were created more recently than the <a href="../s/save.html">save</a>
		whose context is being restored. Since <a href="../r/restore.html">restore</a>
		would destroy those values, but the stacks are unaffected by <a
			href="../r/restore.html">restore</a>, the outcome would be <a
			href="../u/undefined.html">undefined</a> and cannot be allowed.
