	<h3>interrupt (error)</h3>
	<p>
		processes an external request to interrupt execution of a PostScript
		language program. When the interpreter receives an interrupt request,
		it executes interrupt as if it were an error-in other words, it looks
		up the name interrupt in <a href="../e/errordict.html">errordict</a>.
		Execution of interrupt is sandwiched between execution of two objects
		being interpreted in normal sequence.
	</p>
	<p>Unlike most other errors, occurrence of an interrupt does not
		cause the object being executed to be pushed on the operand stack nor
		does it disturb the operand stack in any way.</p>
	<p>The precise nature of an external interrupt request depends on
		the environment in which the PostScript interpreter is running. For
		example, in some environments, receipt of a control-C character from a
		serial communication channel gives rise to the interrupt error. This
		enables a user to explicitly abort a PostScript computation. The
		default definition of interrupt executes a stop.</p>
