	<h3>interrupt (error)</h3>
	<p>
		processes an external request to interrupt execution of a PostScript
		program. When the interpreter receives an interrupt request, it
		executes <b>interrupt</b> as if it were an error&mdash;in other words,
		it looks up the name interrupt in <a href="../e/errordict.html">errordict</a>.
		Execution of <b>interrupt</b> is sandwiched between execution of two
		objects being interpreted in normal sequence.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike most other errors, occurrence of an <b>interrupt</b> error does
		not cause the object being executed to be pushed on the operand stack,
		nor does it disturb the operand stack in any way.
	</p>
	<p>
		The precise nature of an external interrupt request depends on the
		environment in which the PostScript interpreter is running. For
		example, in some environments, receipt of a Control.C character from a
		serial communication channel gives rise to the <b>interrupt</b> error.
		This enables a user to explicitly abort a PostScript computation. The
		default definition of interrupt executes a <a href="../s/stop.html">stop</a>
		operation.
