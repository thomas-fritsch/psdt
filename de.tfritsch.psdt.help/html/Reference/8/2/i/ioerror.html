	<h3>ioerror (error)</h3>
	<p>
		An exception other than end-of-file has occurred during execution of
		one of the file operators. The nature of the exception is environment
		dependent, but may include such events as parity or checksum errors,
		or broken network connections. Attempting to write to an input file or
		to a file that has been closed will also cause an ioerror. Occurrence
		of an ioerror does not cause the file to become closed unless it was
		already closed or the error occurs during <a
			href="../c/closefile.html">closefile</a>.
