	<h3>ioerror (error)</h3>
	<p>
		An exception other than end-of-file has occurred during execution of
		one of the file operators. The nature of the exception is
		environment-dependent, but may include events such as parity or
		checksum errors or broken network connections. Attempting to write to
		an input file or to a file that has been closed will also cause an <b>ioerror</b>.
		Occurrence of an <b>ioerror</b> does not cause the file to be closed
		unless it was already closed or the error occurs during <a
			href="../c/closefile.html">closefile</a>.
