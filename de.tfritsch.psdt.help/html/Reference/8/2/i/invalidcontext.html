	<h3>invalidcontext (error) [DPS]</h3>
	<p>indicates that an invalid use of the context synchronization
		facilities has been detected. Possible causes include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Presenting an invalid context identifier to join or detach.</li>
		<li>Executing monitor on a lock already held by the current
			context.</li>
		<li>Executing wait on a lock not held by the current context.</li>
		<li>Executing any of several synchronization operators when an
			unmatched save is pending if the result would be a deadlock.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The PostScript interpreter detects only the simplest types of
		deadlock. It is possible to encounter deadlocks for which no
		invalidcontext error is generated.</p>
