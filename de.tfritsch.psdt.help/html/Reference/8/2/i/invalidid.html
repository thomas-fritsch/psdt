	<p>indicates that an invalid identifier has been presented to a
		window system specific operator. In each integration of the Display
		PostScript system with a window system, there is a collection of
		window system specific operators. The operands of such operators are
		usually integers that identify windows and other objects that exist
		outside the PostScript language. This error occurs when the operand
		does not identify a valid object. It is generated only by window
		system specific operators and not by any standard operator.</p>
