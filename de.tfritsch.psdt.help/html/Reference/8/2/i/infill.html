	<pre>     x y <b>infill</b> bool
userpath <b>infill</b> bool</pre>
	<p>The first form returns true if the device pixel containing the
		point (x, y) in user space would be painted by a fill of the current
		path in the graphics state. Otherwise, it returns false.</p>
	<p>In the second form, the device pixels that would be painted by
		filling userpath become an &quot;aperture.&quot; This form of the
		operator returns true if any of the pixels in the aperture would be
		painted by a fill of the current path in the graphics state.
		Otherwise, it returns false.</p>
	<p>Both forms of this operator ignore the current clipping path and
		current view clip; that is, they detect a &quot;hit&quot; anywhere
		within the current path, even if filling that path would not mark the
		current page due to clipping. They do not place any marks on the
		current page nor do they disturb the current path. The following
		program fragment takes the current clipping path into account:</p>
