	<h3>nulldevice</h3>
	<pre>- <b>nulldevice</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		installs the null device as the current output device. The null device
		corresponds to no physical output device and has no raster memory
		associated with it. When it is the current device, marks placed on the
		current page by painting operators such as <a href="../s/stroke.html">stroke</a>
		or <a href="../s/show.html">show</a> are discarded, and the output
		operators (<a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a> and <a
			href="../c/copypage.html">copypage</a>) do nothing. In all other
		respects, the null device behaves like a real raster output device:
		graphics operators have their normal side effects on the graphics
		state, font operators invoke the font machinery, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>nulldevice</b> sets the default transformation matrix to be the
		identity transform [1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0]. If desired, a PostScript
		program may change this to any other matrix <a href="s.html#setmatrix">setmatrix</a>)
		in order to simulate the device coordinate system of some real device.
		<b>nulldevice</b> also establishes the clipping path as a degenerate
		path consisting of a single point at the coordinate origin.
	</p>
	<p>
		The null device is useful for exercising the PostScript interpreterâ€™s
		graphics and font machinery for such purposes as operating on paths,
		computing bounding boxes for graphical shapes, and performing
		coordinate transformations without generating output. Such
		manipulations should be bracketed by <a href="../g/gsave.html">gsave</a>
		and <a href="../g/grestore.html">grestore</a> so that the previous
		current device can be reinstated and other side effects of <b>nulldevice</b>
		undone.
