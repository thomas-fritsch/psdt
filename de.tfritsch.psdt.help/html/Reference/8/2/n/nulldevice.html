	<p>
		installs the &quot;null device&quot; as the current output device. The
		null device corresponds to no physical output device and has no raster
		memory associated with it. Marks placed on the current page by
		painting operators (for example, <a href="../s/show.html">show</a> or
		<a href="../s/stroke.html">stroke</a>) are discarded; output operators
		(<a href="../s/showpage.html">showpage</a> and <a
			href="../c/copypage.html">copypage</a>) do nothing. However, in all
		other respects the null device behaves like a real raster output
		device: the graphics operators have their normal side-effects on the
		graphics state, the character operators invoke the font machinery, and
		so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		nulldevice sets the default transformation matrix to be the identity
		transform [1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0]. A PostScript language program may
		change this to any other matrix (using <a href="s.html#setmatrix">setmatrix</a>)
		if it desires to simulate the device coordinate system of some real
		device. nulldevice also establishes the clipping path as a degenerate
		path consisting of a single point at the origin.
	</p>
	<p>
		The null device is useful for exercising the PostScript interpreter's
		graphics and font machinery for such purposes as operating on paths,
		computing bounding boxes for graphical shapes, and performing
		coordinate transformations using CTM without generating output. Such
		manipulations should be bracketed by <a href="../g/gsave.html">gsave</a>
		and <a href="../g/grestore.html">grestore</a> so the former device can
		be reinstated and the other side effects of nulldevice undone.
