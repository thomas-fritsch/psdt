<h1>Postscript Operators 't'</h1>
<hr>
<b id="timeout">timeout</b> (error)
<p>
A time limit has been exceeded; that is, a PostScript language program has
executed for too long or has waited too long for some external event to
occur.
<p>
Execution of timeout is sandwiched between execution of two objects being
interpreted in normal sequence. Unlike most other errors, occurrence of
a timeout does not cause the object being executed to be pushed on the operand
stack nor does it disturb the operand stack in any way.
<p>
The PostScript language does not define any standard causes for timeout
errors. However, a PostScript interpreter running in a particular environment
may provide a set of timeout facilities appropriate for that environment.
<hr>
<b id="token">token</b>
<pre>  file token any true (if found)
             false    (if not found)
string token post any true (if found)
             false         (if not found)</pre>
<p>
reads characters from file or string, interpreting them according to the
PostScript language syntax rules, until it has scanned and constructed an
entire object.
<p>
In the file case, token normally pushes the scanned object followed by true.
If token reaches end-of-file before encountering any characters besides
white space, it closes file and returns false.
<p>
In the string case, token normally pushes post (the substring of string
beyond the portion consumed by token), the scanned object, and true. If
token reaches the end of string before encountering any characters besides
white space, it simply returns false.
<p>
In either case, the any result is an ordinary object. It may be simple-an
integer, real, or name-or composite-a string bracketed by (...) or a procedure
bracketed by {...}. The object returned by token is the same as the object
that would be encountered by the interpreter if the file or string were
executed directly. However, token scans just a single object and it always
pushes that object on the operand stack rather than executing it.
<p>
token consumes all characters of the token and sometimes the terminating
character as well. If the token is a name or a number followed by a white-space
character, token consumes the white-space character (only the first one
if there are several). If the token is terminated by a special character
that is part of the token-one of ), &gt;, ], or }-token consumes that character,
but no following ones. If the token is terminated by a special character
that is part of the next token-one of /, (, &lt;, [, or {-token does not
consume that character, but leaves it in the input sequence. If the token
is a binary token or a binary object sequence, token consumes no additional
characters.
<p>

(15(St1) {1 2 add}) token   &rArr;  ((St1) {1 2 add}) 15 true

( ) token                   &rArr;  false

<b id="transform">transform</b>
<pre>       x y transform x' y'
x y matrix transform x' y'</pre>
<p>
With no matrix operand, transform transforms the user space coordinate (x,
y) by CTM to produce the corresponding device space coordinate (x', y').
If the matrix operand is supplied, transform transforms (x, y) by matrix
rather than by CTM.

<b id="translate">translate</b>
<pre>       t<sub>x</sub> t<sub>y</sub> translate -
t<sub>x</sub> t<sub>y</sub> matrix translate matrix</pre>
<p>
With no matrix operand, translate builds a temporary matrix and concatenates
this matrix with the current transformation matrix (CTM). Precisely, translate
replaces the CTM by T x CTM. The effect of this is to move the origin of
the user coordinate system by tx units in the x direction and ty units in
the y direction relative to the former user coordinate system. The sizes
of the x and y units and the orientation of the axes are unchanged.
<p>
If the matrix operand is supplied, translate replaces the value of matrix
by T and pushes the modified matrix back on the operand stack. In this case,
translate does not affect the CTM.

<b id="true">true</b>

<p>
pushes a boolean object whose value is true on the operand stack. true is
not an operator; it is a name in <a href="s.html#systemdict">systemdict</a>
associated with the boolean value true.

<b id="truncate">truncate</b>
<pre>num<sub>1</sub> truncate num<sub>2</sub></pre>
<p>
truncates num<sub>1</sub> toward zero by removing its fractional part. The type of
the result is the same as the type of the operand.
<p>
<b>Examples</b>
<pre>
 3.2 truncate  &rArr;   3.0

 99  truncate  &rArr;   99

<hr>
<b id="type">type</b>
<pre>any type name</pre>
<p>
returns a name object that identifies the type of the object any. The possible
names that type can return are as follows: 
<pre>
arraytype     marktype 
booleantype   nametype 
conditiontype nulltype 
dicttype      operatortype 
filetype      packedarraytype 
fonttype      realtype 
gstatetype    savetype 
integertype   stringtype 
locktype 
</pre>
<p>
The name fonttype identifies an object of type fontID. It has nothing to
do with a font dictionary, which is identified by dicttype the same as any
other dictionary.
<p>
The returned name has the executable attribute. This makes it convenient
to perform type-dependent processing of an object simply by executing the
name returned by type in the context of a dictionary that defines all the
type names to have procedure values (this is how <a href="@.html#twoequals">==</a>
works).
<p>
The set of types is subject to enlargement in future revisions of the language.
A program that examines the types of arbitrary objects should be prepared
to behave reasonably if type returns a name that is not in this list.

<b id="typecheck">typecheck</b> (error)
<p>
Some operand's type is different from what an operator expects. This is
probably the most frequent error encountered. It is often the result of
faulty stack manipulation, such as operands supplied in the wrong order
or procedures leaving results on the stack when they are not supposed to.
<p>
Certain operators require dictionaries or other composite objects as operands,
constructed according to specific rules (for example, pattern dictionaries
or user paths). A typecheck error can occur if the contents of such objects
are of incorrect type or are otherwise malformed.
