	<h3>reversepath</h3>
	<pre>- <b>reversepath</b> -</pre>
	<p>replaces the current path with an equivalent one whose segments
		are defined in the reverse order. The operation reverses the
		directions and order of segments within each subpath of the current
		path; the relative order of subpaths within the path as a whole is
		unspecified and unpredictable.</p>
	<p>
		If a subpath ends with a <a href="../c/closepath.html">closepath</a>
		operation, the reversed subpath begins at the point that was the
		beginning of the original closepath segment. The segment added by <a
			href="../c/closepath.html">closepath</a> thus remains at the end of
		the subpath, though it is traversed in the opposite direction.
