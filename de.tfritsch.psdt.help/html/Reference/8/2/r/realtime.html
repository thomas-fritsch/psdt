	<pre>- <b>realtime</b> int</pre>
	<p>
		returns the value of a clock that counts in real time, independently
		of the execution of the PostScript interpreter. The clock's starting
		value is arbitrary; it has no defined meaning in terms of calendar
		time. The unit of time represented by the <b>realtime</b> value is one
		millisecond. However, the rate at which it changes is
		implementation-dependent. As the time value becomes greater than the
		largest integer allowed in a particular implementation, it "wraps" to
		the smallest (most negative) integer.
