	<b>realtime</b> LEVEL 2
	<pre>- <b>realtime</b> int</pre>
	<p>returns the value of a clock that counts in real time,
		independent of the execution of the PostScript interpreter. The
		clock's starting value is arbitrary; it has no defined meaning in
		terms of calendar time. The unit of time represented by the realtime
		value is one millisecond. However, the rate at which it changes is
		implementation dependent. As the time value becomes greater than the
		largest integer allowed in a particular implementation, it
		&quot;wraps&quot; to the smallest (most negative) integer.</p>
