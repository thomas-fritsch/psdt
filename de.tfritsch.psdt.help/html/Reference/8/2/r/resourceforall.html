	<b>resourceforall</b> LEVEL 2
	<pre>template proc scratch category <b>resourceforall</b> -</pre>
	<p>enumerates the names of all instances of a specified resource
		category or a subset selected by template. category is a name object
		that identifies a resource category, such as Font. template is a
		string object to be matched against names of resource instances. For
		each matching name, resourceforall copies the name into the supplied
		scratch string, pushes a string object that is the substring of
		scratch that was actually used, and calls proc. resourceforall does
		not return any results of its own, but proc may do so.</p>
	<p>The template is matched against the names of resource instances,
		treating them as if they were strings. Within the template, all
		characters are treated literally and are case sensitive, with the
		exception of the following:</p>
	<p>
	<dl>
		<dt>*</dt>
		<dd>matches zero or more consecutive characters.</dd>
		<dt>?</dt>
		<dd>matches exactly one character.</dd>
		<dt>\</dt>
		<dd>causes the next character of the template to be treated
			literally, even if it is *, ?, or \.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Note that the scratch string is reused during every call to
		proc. If proc wishes to save the string that is passed to it, it must
		make a copy or use cvn to convert the string to a name. Use of strings
		instead of names allows resourceforall to function without creating
		new name objects, which would consume VM needlessly during a large
		enumeration. It is prudent to provide a scratch string at least as
		long as the implementation limit for names.</p>
	<p>It is possible for a resource instance to have a key which is
		not a name or string. Such a key matches only the template (*). In
		this case, resourceforall passes the key directly to proc instead of
		copying it into the scratch string. This case can arise only for a
		resource instance defined in VM by a previous defineresource; the keys
		for external resource instances are always names or strings.</p>
	<p>Like resourcestatus, but unlike findresource, resourceforall
		never loads a resource instance into VM.</p>
	<p>resourceforall enumerates the resource instances in order of
		status (the status value returned by resourcestatus); that is, it
		enumerates groups in this order:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Instances defined in VM by an explicit defineresource; not
			subject to automatic removal.</li>
		<li>Instances defined in VM by a previous execution of
			findresource; subject to automatic removal.</li>
		<li>Instances not currently defined in VM, but available from
			external storage.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Within each group, the order of enumeration is unpredictable. It
		is unrelated to order of definition or to whether the definition is
		local or global. A given resource instance is enumerated only once,
		even if it exists in more than one group. If proc adds or removes
		resource instances, those instances may or may not appear later in the
		same enumeration.</p>
	<p>
		Like resourcestatus, resourceforall considers both local and global
		definitions if the current VM allocation mode is local, but only
		global definitions if the current VM allocation mode is global (see <a
			href="resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a> and <a
			href="../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		If the specified resource category does not exist, an <a
			href="../u/undefined.html">undefined</a> error occurs. However, no
		error occurs if there are no instances whose names match the template.
		Of course, the proc that is called can generate errors of its own.
