	<pre>template proc scratch category <b>resourceforall</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		enumerates the names of all instances of a specified resource category
		or a subset selected by <i>template</i>. <i>category</i> is a name
		object that identifies a resource category, such as <b>Font</b> (see
		Section <a href="../../../3/9/2.html">3.9.2, "Resource Categories"</a>).
		<i>template</i> is a string object to be matched against names of
		resource instances. For each matching name, <b>resourceforall</b>
		copies the name into the supplied <i>scratch</i> string, pushes a
		string object designating the substring of scratch actually used, and
		calls <i>proc</i>. <b>resourceforall</b> does not return any results
		of its own, but <i>proc</i> may do so.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>template</i> is matched against the names of resource instances,
		treating them as if they were strings. Within the template, all
		characters are treated literally and are case-sensitive, with the
		exception of the following:
	</p>
	<p>
	<dl>
		<dt>*</dt>
		<dd>Matches zero or more consecutive characters.</dd>
		<dt>?</dt>
		<dd>Matches exactly one character.</dd>
		<dt>\</dt>
		<dd>
			Causes the next character of the template to be treated literally,
			even if it is *, ?, or \. Note that \ is treated as an escape
			character in a string literal. Thus, if <i>template</i> is a string
			literal, \\ must be used to represent \ in the resulting string.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>
		The scratch string is reused during every call to <i>proc</i>. If <i>proc</i>
		wishes to save the string that is passed to it, it must make a copy or
		use <a href="../c/cvn.html">cvn</a> to convert the string to a name.
		The use of strings instead of names allows <b>resourceforall</b> to
		function without creating new name objects, which would consume
		virtual memory needlessly during a large enumeration. It is prudent to
		provide a scratch string at least as long as the implementation limit
		for names (see <a href="../../../B.html">Appendix B</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		A resource instance can have a key that is not a name or a string, but
		such a key matches only the template (*). In this case, <b>resourceforall</b>
		passes the key directly to <i>proc</i> instead of copying it into the
		scratch string. This case can arise only for a resource instance
		defined in virtual memory by a previous <a
			href="../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>; the keys for
		external resource instances are always names or strings.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like <a href="resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a>, but unlike <a
			href="../f/findresource.html">findresource</a>, <b>resourceforall</b>
		never loads a resource instance into VM.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>resourceforall</b> enumerates the resource instances in order of
		status (the status value returned by <a href="resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a>);
		that is, it enumerates groups in this order:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Instances defined in VM by an explicit <a
			href="../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>; not subject to
			automatic removal.
		</li>
		<li>Instances defined in VM by a previous execution of <a
			href="../f/findresource.html">findresource</a>; subject to automatic
			removal.
		</li>
		<li>Instances not currently defined in VM, but available from
			external storage.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Within each group, the order of enumeration is unpredictable. It
		is unrelated to order of definition or to whether the definition is
		local or global. A given resource instance is enumerated only once,
		even if it exists in more than one group. If proc adds or removes
		resource instances, those instances may or may not appear later in the
		same enumeration.</p>
	<p>
		Like <a href="resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a>, <b>resourceforall</b>
		considers both local and global definitions if the current VM
		allocation mode is local, but only global definitions if the current
		VM allocation mode is global (see <a href="resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a>
		and <a href="../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		If the specified resource category does not exist, an <a
			href="../u/undefined.html">undefined</a> error occurs. However, no
		error occurs if there are no instances whose names match the template.
		Of course, the <i>proc</i> that is called can generate errors of its
		own.
