		intersects the inside of the current clipping path with a rectangular
		path the operands describe. In the first form, the operands are four
		numbers that describe a single rectangle. In the other two forms, the
		operand is an <a href="../a/array.html">array</a> or an encoded number
		string that describes an arbitrary number of rectangles. After
		computing the new clipping path, rectclip resets the current path to
		empty, as if by <a href="../n/newpath.html">newpath</a>.
	</p>
	<p>In the first form, assuming width and height are positive,
		rectclip is equivalent to:</p>
	<pre>
newpath
  x y moveto
  width 0 rlineto
  0 height rlineto
  width neg 0 rlineto
  closepath
  clip
newpath
</pre>
	<p>Note that if the second or third form is used to specify
		multiple rectangles, the rectangles are treated together as a single
		path and used for a single clip operation. The &quot;inside&quot; of
		this combined path is the union of all the rectangular subpaths,
		because the paths are all drawn in the same direction and the non-zero
		winding number rule is used.</p>
