	<b>readstring</b>
	<pre>file string <b>readstring</b> substring bool</pre>
	<p>reads characters from file and stores them into successive
		elements of string until either the entire string has been filled or
		an end-of-file indication is encountered in file. readstring then
		returns the substring of string that was filled and a boolean
		indicating the outcome (true normally, false if end-of-file was
		encountered before the string was filled).</p>
	<p>All character codes are treated the same-as integers in the
		range 0 to 255. There are no special characters (in particular, the
		newline character is not treated specially). However, the
		communication channel may usurp certain control characters.</p>
