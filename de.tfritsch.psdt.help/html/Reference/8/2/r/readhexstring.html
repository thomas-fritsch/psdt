	<h3>readhexstring</h3>
	<pre>file string <b>readhexstring</b> substring bool</pre>
	<p>reads characters from file, expecting to encounter a sequence of
		hexadecimal digits 0 through 9 and A through F (or a through f).
		readhexstring interprets each successive pair of digits as a two-digit
		hexadecimal number representing an integer value in the range 0 to
		255. It then stores these values into successive elements of string
		starting at index 0 until either the entire string has been filled or
		an end-of-file indication is encountered in file. Finally,
		readhexstring returns the substring of string that was filled and a
		boolean indicating the outcome (true normally, false if end-of-file
		was encountered before the string was filled).</p>
	<p>readhexstring ignores any characters that are not valid
		hexadecimal digits, so the data in file may be interspersed with
		spaces, newlines, etc., without changing the interpretation of the
		data.</p>
