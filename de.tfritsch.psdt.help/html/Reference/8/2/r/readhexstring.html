	<h3>readhexstring</h3>
	<pre>file string <b>readhexstring</b> substring bool</pre>
	<p>
		reads characters from <i>file</i>, expecting to encounter a sequence
		of hexadecimal digits 0 to 9 and A through F (or a through f). <b>readhexstring</b>
		interprets each successive pair of digits as a two-digit hexadecimal
		number representing an integer value in the range 0 to 255. It then
		stores these values into successive elements of <i>string</i> starting
		at index 0 until either the entire string has been filled or an
		end-of-file indication is encountered in <i>file</i>. Finally, <b>readhexstring</b>
		returns the substring of <i>string</i> that was filled and a boolean
		indicating the outcome (<i>true</i> normally, <i>false</i> if
		end-of-file was encountered before the string was filled).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>readhexstring</b> ignores any characters that are not valid
		hexadecimal digits, so the data in <i>file</i> may be interspersed
		with spaces, newlines, etc., without changing the interpretation of
		the data.

		See Section <a href="../../../3/8/4.html">3.8.4, "Filters,"</a> for
		more information about ASCII-encoded, binary data representations and
		how to deal with them.
