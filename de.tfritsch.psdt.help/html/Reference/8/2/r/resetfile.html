	<p>
		discards buffered characters belonging to a file object. For an input
		file, <b>resetfile</b> discards any characters that have been received
		from the source but not yet consumed. For an output file, it discards
		any characters that have been written to the file but not yet
		delivered to their destination. <b>resetfile</b> never generates an <a
			href="../i/ioerror.html">ioerror</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This operator may have other side effects that depend on the
		properties of the underlying file. For example, it may restart
		communication via a channel that was blocked waiting for buffer space
		to become available. <b>resetfile</b> never waits for characters to be
		received or transmitted.
