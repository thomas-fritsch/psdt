	<b>readline</b>
	<pre>file string <b>readline</b> substring bool</pre>
	<p>reads a line of characters (terminated by a newline character)
		from file and stores them into successive elements of string. readline
		then returns the substring of string that was filled and a boolean
		indicating the outcome (true normally, false if end-of-file was
		encountered before a newline character was read).</p>
	<p>A &quot;line of characters&quot; is a sequential string of ASCII
		characters, including space, tab, and non-printing &quot;control&quot;
		characters. A line terminates with a newline-a carriage return
		character, a line-feed character, or both.</p>
	<p>
		The terminating newline character is not stored into string or
		included at the end of the returned substring. If readline completely
		fills string before encountering a newline character, it executes the
		error <a href="rangecheck.html">rangecheck</a>.
