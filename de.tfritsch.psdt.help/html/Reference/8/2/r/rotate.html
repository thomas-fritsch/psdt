	<h3>rotate</h3>
	<pre>       angle <b>rotate</b> -
angle matrix <b>rotate</b> matrix -</pre>
	<p>With no matrix operand, rotate builds a temporary matrix where q
		is the operand angle in degrees, and concatenates this matrix with the
		current transformation matrix (CTM). Precisely, rotate replaces the
		CTM by R x CTM. The effect of this is to rotate the user coordinate
		system axes about their origin by angle degrees (positive is
		counterclockwise) with respect to their former orientation. The
		position of the user coordinate origin and the sizes of the x and y
		units are unchanged.</p>
	<p>If the matrix operand is supplied, rotate replaces the value of
		matrix by R and pushes the modified matrix back on the operand stack.
		In this case, rotate does not affect the CTM.</p>
