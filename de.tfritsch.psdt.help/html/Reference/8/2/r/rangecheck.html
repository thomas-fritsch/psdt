	<h3>rangecheck (error)</h3>
	<p>
		A numeric operand's value is outside the range expected by an
		operator&mdash;for example, an array or string index is out of bounds,
		or a negative number appears where a non-negative number is required.
		<b>rangecheck</b> can also occur if a matrix operand does not contain
		exactly six elements.
