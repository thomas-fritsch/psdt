	<b>rangecheck</b> (error)
	<p>A numeric operand's value is outside the range expected by an
		operator-for example, an array or string index is out of bounds, or a
		negative number appears where a non-negative number is required.
		rangecheck can also occur if a matrix operand does not contain exactly
		six elements.</p>
