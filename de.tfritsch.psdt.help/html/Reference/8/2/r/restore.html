	<h3>restore</h3>
	<pre>save <b>restore</b> -</pre>
	<p>resets the virtual memory (VM) to the state represented by the
		supplied save object-in other words, the state at the time the
		corresponding save was executed.</p>
	<p>If the current execution context supports job encapsulation and
		if save represents the outermost saved VM state for this context, then
		objects in both local and global VM revert to their saved state. If
		the current context does not support job encapsulation or if save is
		not the outermost saved VM state for this context, then only objects
		in local VM revert to their saved state; objects in global VM are
		undisturbed.</p>
	<p>restore can reset the VM to the state represented by any save
		object that is still valid, not necessarily the one produced by the
		most recent save. After restoring the VM, restore invalidates its save
		operand along with any other save objects created more recently than
		that one. That is, a VM snapshot can be used only once; to restore the
		same environment repeatedly, it is necessary to do a new save each
		time.</p>
	<p>restore does not alter the contents of the operand, dictionary,
		or execution stack, except to pop its save operand. If any of these
		stacks contains composite objects whose values reside in local VM and
		are newer than the snapshot being restored, restore executes the
		invalidrestore error. This restriction applies to save objects and, in
		Level 1 implementations, to name objects.</p>
	<p>restore does alter the graphics state stack: It performs the
		equivalent of a grestoreall and then removes the graphics state
		created by save from the graphics state stack. restore also resets
		several per-context parameters to their state at the time of save.
		These include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Array packing mode (see setpacking).</li>
		<li>VM allocation mode (see setglobal).</li>
		<li>Object output format (see setobjectformat).</li>
		<li>View clipping path (see viewclip).</li>
		<li>All user interpreter parameters (see setuserparams).</li>
	</ul>
