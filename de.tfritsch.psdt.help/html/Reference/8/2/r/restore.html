	<h3>restore</h3>
	<pre>save <b>restore</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		resets the virtual memory (VM) to the state represented by the
		supplied save object&mdash;in other words, the state at the time the
		corresponding <a href="../s/save.html">save</a> was executed. See
		Section <a href="../../../3/7.html">3.7, "Memory Management,"</a> for
		a description of VM and the effects of save and restore.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the current execution context supports job encapsulation and if <i>save</i>
		represents the outermost saved VM state for this context, then objects
		in both local and global VM revert to their saved state. If the
		current context does not support job encapsulation or if <i>save</i>
		is not the outermost saved VM state for this context, then only
		objects in local VM revert to their saved state; objects in global VM
		are undisturbed. Job encapsulation is described in Section <a
			href="../../../3/7/7.html">3.7.7, "Job Execution Environment."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		restore can reset the VM to the state represented by any save object
		that is still valid, not necessarily the one produced by the most
		recent <a href="../s/save.html">save</a>. After restoring the VM,
		restore invalidates its <i>save</i> operand along with any other save
		objects created more recently than that one. That is, a VM snapshot
		can be used only once; to restore the same environment repeatedly, it
		is necessary to do a new <a href="../s/save.html">save</a> each time.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>restore</b> does not alter the contents of the operand, dictionary,
		or execution stack, except to pop its <i>save</i> operand. If any of
		these stacks contains composite objects whose values reside in local
		VM and are newer than the snapshot being restored, an <a
			href="../i/invalidrestore.html">invalidrestore</a> error occurs. This
		restriction applies to save objects and, in LanguageLevel 1, to name
		objects.
	</p>
	<p>
		restore does alter the graphics state stack: It performs the
		equivalent of a <a href="../g/grestoreall.html">grestoreall</a> and
		then removes the graphics state created by <a href="../s/save.html">save</a>
		from the graphics state stack. <b>restore</b> also resets several
		per-context parameters to their state at the time of <a
			href="../s/save.html">save</a>. These include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Array packing mode (see <a href="../s/setpacking.html">setpacking</a>).
		</li>
		<li>VM allocation mode (see <a href="../s/setglobal.html">setglobal</a>).
		</li>
		<li>Object output format (see <a href="../s/setobjectformat.html">setobjectformat</a>).
		</li>
		<li>All user interpreter parameters (see <a
			href="../s/setuserparams.html">setuserparams</a>).
		</li>
	</ul>
