	<h3>typecheck (error)</h3>
	<p>Some operand's type is different from what an operator expects.
		This is probably the most frequent error encountered. It is often the
		result of faulty stack manipulation, such as operands supplied in the
		wrong order or procedures leaving results on the stack when they are
		not supposed to.</p>
	<p>Certain operators require dictionaries or other composite
		objects as operands, constructed according to specific rules (for
		example, pattern dictionaries or user paths). A typecheck error can
		occur if the contents of such objects are of incorrect type or are
		otherwise malformed.</p>
