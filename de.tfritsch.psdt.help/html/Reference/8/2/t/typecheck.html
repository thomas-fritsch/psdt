	<h3>typecheck (error)</h3>
	<p>An operand's type is different from what an operator expects, or
		an operand is a literal array or a literal packed array when an
		operator expects a procedure (an executable array or an executable
		packed array). This is probably the most frequently occurring error.
		It is often the result of faulty stack manipulation, such as operands
		supplied in the wrong order or procedures leaving results on the stack
		when they are not supposed to.</p>
	<p>
		Certain operators require dictionaries or other composite objects as
		operands, constructed according to specific rules (for example,
		pattern dictionaries or user paths). A <b>typecheck</b> error can
		occur if the contents of such objects are of incorrect type or are
		otherwise malformed.
