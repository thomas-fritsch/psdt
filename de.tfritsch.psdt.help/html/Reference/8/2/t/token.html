	<h3>token</h3>
	<pre>  file <b>token</b> any true (if found)
             false    (if not found)
string <b>token</b> post any true (if found)
             false         (if not found)</pre>
	<p>reads characters from file or string, interpreting them
		according to the PostScript language syntax rules, until it has
		scanned and constructed an entire object.</p>
	<p>In the file case, token normally pushes the scanned object
		followed by true. If token reaches end-of-file before encountering any
		characters besides white space, it closes file and returns false.</p>
	<p>In the string case, token normally pushes post (the substring of
		string beyond the portion consumed by token), the scanned object, and
		true. If token reaches the end of string before encountering any
		characters besides white space, it simply returns false.</p>
	<p>In either case, the any result is an ordinary object. It may be
		simple-an integer, real, or name-or composite-a string bracketed by
		(...) or a procedure bracketed by {...}. The object returned by token
		is the same as the object that would be encountered by the interpreter
		if the file or string were executed directly. However, token scans
		just a single object and it always pushes that object on the operand
		stack rather than executing it.</p>
	<p>token consumes all characters of the token and sometimes the
		terminating character as well. If the token is a name or a number
		followed by a white-space character, token consumes the white-space
		character (only the first one if there are several). If the token is
		terminated by a special character that is part of the token-one of ),
		&gt;, ], or }-token consumes that character, but no following ones. If
		the token is terminated by a special character that is part of the
		next token-one of /, (, &lt;, [, or {-token does not consume that
		character, but leaves it in the input sequence. If the token is a
		binary token or a binary object sequence, token consumes no additional
		characters.</p>
