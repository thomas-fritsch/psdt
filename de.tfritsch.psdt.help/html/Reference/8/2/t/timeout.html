	<h3>timeout (error)</h3>
	<p>A time limit has been exceeded; that is, a PostScript language
		program has executed for too long or has waited too long for some
		external event to occur.</p>
	<p>Execution of timeout is sandwiched between execution of two
		objects being interpreted in normal sequence. Unlike most other
		errors, occurrence of a timeout does not cause the object being
		executed to be pushed on the operand stack nor does it disturb the
		operand stack in any way.</p>
	<p>The PostScript language does not define any standard causes for
		timeout errors. However, a PostScript interpreter running in a
		particular environment may provide a set of timeout facilities
		appropriate for that environment.</p>
