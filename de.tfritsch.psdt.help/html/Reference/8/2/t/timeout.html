	<h3>timeout (error)</h3>
	<p>A time limit has been exceeded; that is, a PostScript program
		has executed for too long or has waited too long for some external
		event to occur.</p>
	<p>
		Execution of <b>timeout</b> is sandwiched between execution of two
		objects being interpreted in normal sequence. Unlike most other
		errors, the occurrence of a <b>timeout</b> error does not cause the
		object being executed to be pushed on the operand stack, nor does it
		disturb the operand stack in any way.
	</p>
	<p>
		The PostScript language does not define any standard causes for <b>timeout</b>
		errors. However, a PostScript interpreter running in a particular
		environment may provide a set of timeout facilities appropriate for
		that environment.
