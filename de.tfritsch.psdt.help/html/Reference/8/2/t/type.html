	<h3>type</h3>
	<pre>any <b>type</b> name</pre>
	<p>returns a name object that identifies the type of the object
		any. The possible names that type can return are as follows:</p>
	<pre>
arraytype                      nametype 
booleantype                    nulltype 
dicttype                       operatortype 
filetype                       packedarraytype <i>(LanguageLevel 2)</i> 
fonttype                       realtype
gstatetype <i>(LanguageLevel 2)</i>   savetype 
integertype                    stringtype 
marktype
</pre>
	<p>
		The name fonttype identifies an object of type <i>fontID</i>. It has
		nothing to do with a font dictionary, which is identified by dicttype
		the same as any other dictionary.
	</p>
	<p>
		The returned name has the executable attribute. This makes it
		convenient to perform type-dependent processing of an object simply by
		executing the name returned by <b>type</b> in the context of a
		dictionary that defines all the type names to have procedure values
		(this is how <a href="../@/equals-equals.html">==</a> works).
	</p>
	<p>
		The set of types is subject to enlargement in future revisions of the
		language. A program that examines the types of arbitrary objects
		should be prepared to behave reasonably if <b>type</b> returns a name
		that is not in this list.
