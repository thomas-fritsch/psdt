	<h3>kshow</h3>
	<pre>proc string <b>kshow</b> -</pre>
	<p>paints the characters of string in a manner similar to show, but
		allowing program intervention between characters. If the character
		codes in string are c0, c1, ... cn, kshow proceeds as follows: First
		it shows c0 at the current point, updating the current point by c0's
		width. Then it pushes the character codes c0 and c1 on the operand
		stack (as integers) and executes proc. The proc may perform any
		actions it wishes; typically, it will modify the current point to
		affect the subsequent placement of c1. kshow continues by showing c1,
		pushing c1 and c2 on the stack, executing proc, and so on. It finishes
		by pushing cn-1 and cn on the stack, executing proc, and finally
		showing cn.</p>
	<p>When proc is called for the first time, the graphics state (in
		particular, the CTM) is the same as it was at the time kshow was
		invoked, except that the current point has been updated by the width
		of c0. Execution of proc is permitted to have any side effects,
		including changes to the graphics state. Such changes persist from one
		call of proc to the next and may affect graphical output for the
		remainder of kshow's execution and afterward.</p>
	<p>The name kshow is derived from &quot;kern-show.&quot; To kern
		characters is to adjust the spacing between adjacent pairs of
		characters in order to achieve a visually pleasing result. The kshow
		operator enables user-defined kerning and other manipulations, because
		arbitrary computations can be performed between each pair of
		characters.</p>
	<p>
		kshow can be applied only to base fonts. If the current font is
		composite, kshow issues an <a href="../i/invalidfont.html">invalidfont</a>
		error.
