	<h3>kshow</h3>
	<pre>proc string <b>kshow</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		paints glyphs for the characters of string in a manner similar to <a>show</a>,
		but allows program intervention between characters. If the character
		codes in <i>string</i> are <i>char<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>char<sub>1</sub></i>,
		... <i>char<sub>n</sub></i>, <b>kshow</b> proceeds as follows: First
		it shows the glyph for <i>char<sub>0</sub></i> at the current point,
		updating the current point by the width of that glyph. Then it pushes
		the character codes <i>char<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>char<sub>1</sub></i>
		on the operand stack (as integers) and executes <i>proc</i>. <i>proc</i>
		may perform any actions it wishes; typically, it will modify the
		current point to affect the subsequent placement of the glyph for <i>char<sub>1</sub></i>.
		<b>kshow</b> continues by showing the glyph for <i>char<sub>1</sub></i>,
		pushing <i>char<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>char<sub>2</sub></i> on the
		stack, executing <i>proc</i>, and so on. It finishes by pushing <i>char<sub>n-1</sub></i>
		and <i>char<sub>n</sub></i> on the stack, executing <i>proc</i>, and
		finally showing the glyph for <i>char<sub>n</sub></i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		When <i>proc</i> is called for the first time, the graphics state (in
		particular, the current transformation matrix) is the same as it was
		at the time <b>kshow</b> was invoked, except that the current point
		has been updated by the width of the glyph for <i>char<sub>0</sub></i>.
		Execution of <i>proc</i> is permitted to have any side effects,
		including changes to the graphics state. Such changes persist from one
		call of <i>proc</i> to the next and may affect graphical output for
		the remainder of <b>kshow</b>'s execution and afterward. When <i>proc</i>
		completes execution, the value of <a href="../c/currentfont.html">currentfont</a>
		is restored.
	</p>
	<p>
		The name <b>kshow</b> is derived from "kern-show." To kern glyphs is
		to adjust the spacing between adjacent glyphs in order to achieve a
		visually pleasing result. The <b>kshow</b> operator enables
		user-defined kerning and other manipulations, because arbitrary
		computations can be performed between pairs of glyphs.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>kshow</b> can be applied only to base fonts. If the current font is
		a composite font, an <a href="../i/invalidfont.html">invalidfont</a>
		error occurs.
