	<pre>obj tag <b>printobject</b> -</pre>
	<p>writes a binary object sequence to the standard output file. The
		binary object sequence contains a top-level array whose length is one;
		its single element is an encoding of obj. If obj is composite, the
		binary object sequence also includes subsidiary array and string
		values for the components of obj. The tag operand, which must be an
		integer in the range 0 to 255, is used to tag the top-level object; it
		appears as the second byte of the object's representation.</p>
	<p>Tag values 0 through 249 are available for general use; tag
		values 250 through 255 are reserved for special purposes, such as
		reporting errors.</p>
	<p>
		The binary object sequence uses the number representation established
		by the most recent execution of setobjectformat. The token type given
		as the first byte of the binary object sequence reflects the number
		representation that was used. If the object format parameter has been
		set to zero, printobject executes an <a href="../u/undefined.html">undefined</a>
		error.
	</p>
	<p>
		The object obj and its components must be of type null, integer, real,
		name, boolean, string, array, or mark. Appearance of an object of any
		other type, including packed array, will result in a typecheck error.
		If arrays are nested too deeply or are cyclical, a <a
			href="../l/limitcheck.html">limitcheck</a> error occurs.
	</p>
	<p>printobject always encodes a name object as a reference to a
		text name in the string value portion of the binary object sequence,
		never as a system or user name index.</p>
	<p>As is the case for all operators that write to files, the output
		produced by printobject may accumulate in a buffer instead of being
		transmitted immediately. To ensure immediate transmission, a flush is
		required. This is particularly important in situations where the
		output produced by printobject is the response to a query from the
		application.</p>
