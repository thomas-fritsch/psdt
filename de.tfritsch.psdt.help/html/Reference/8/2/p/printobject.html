	<pre>obj tag <b>printobject</b> -</pre>
	<p>
		writes a binary object sequence to the standard output file (see
		Section <a href="../../../3/14/6.html">3.14.6, "Structured Output"</a>).
		The binary object sequence contains a top-level array consisting of a
		single element that is an encoding of <i>obj</i>. If <i>obj</i> is
		composite, the binary object sequence also includes subsidiary array
		and string values for the components of <i>obj</i>. The <i>tag</i>
		operand, which must be an integer in the range 0 to 255, is used to
		tag the top-level object; it appears as the second byte of the
		objectâ€™s representation. Tag values 0 to 249 are available for general
		use; tag values 250 to 255 are reserved for special purposes, such as
		reporting errors.
	</p>
	<p>
		The binary object sequence uses the number representation established
		by the most recent execution of <a href="../s/setobjectformat.html">setobjectformat</a>.
		The token type given as the first byte of the binary object sequence
		reflects the number representation that was used. If the object format
		parameter has been set to zero, printobject executes an <a
			href="../u/undefined.html">undefined</a> error.
	</p>
	<p>
		The object <i>obj</i> and its components must be of type null,
		integer, real, name, boolean, string, array, or mark (see Section <a
			href="../../../3/14.html">3.14, "Binary Encoding Details"</a>).
		Appearance of an object of any other type, including packed array,
		will result in a typecheck error. If arrays are nested too deeply or
		are cyclical, a <a href="../l/limitcheck.html">limitcheck</a> error
		occurs.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>printobject</b> always encodes a name object as a reference to a
		text name in the string value portion of the binary object sequence,
		never as a system name index.
	</p>
	<p>
		As is the case for all operators that write to files, the output
		produced by <b>printobject</b> may accumulate in a buffer instead of
		being transmitted immediately. To ensure immediate transmission
		invoking <a href="../f/flush.html">flush</a> is required. This is
		particularly important in situations where the output produced by <b>printobject</b>
		is the response to a query from the application.
