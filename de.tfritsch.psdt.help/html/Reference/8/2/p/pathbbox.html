	<pre>- <b>pathbbox</b> ll<sub>x</sub> ll<sub>y</sub> ur<sub>x</sub> ur<sub>y</sub></pre>
	<p>
		returns the bounding box of the current path in the current user
		coordinate system. The results are four real numbers: lower-left x,
		lower-left y, upper-right x, and upper-right y. These coordinates
		describe a rectangle, oriented with its sides parallel to the x and y
		axes in user space, that completely encloses all elements of the path.
		If the current path is empty, pathbbox executes the error <a
			href="../n/nocurrentpoint.html">nocurrentpoint</a>.
	</p>
	<p>pathbbox first computes the bounding box of the current path in
		device space. It then transforms these coordinates to user space by
		the inverse of CTM and computes the bounding box of the resulting
		figure in user space. If the user coordinate system is rotated (other
		than by multiples of 90 degrees) or skewed, pathbbox may return a
		bounding box that is larger than expected.</p>
	<p>
		If the path includes curve segments, the bounding box encloses the
		control points of the curves as well as the curves themselves. To
		obtain a bounding box that fits the path more tightly, one should
		first &quot;flatten&quot; the curve segments by executing <a
			href="../f/flattenpath.html">flattenpath</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Level 2 implementations of the PostScript language, if the current
		path ends with a <a href="../m/moveto.html">moveto</a>, the bounding
		box does not necessarily include it, unless the moveto is the only
		element of the path. If an explicit bounding box has been established
		by <a href="../s/setbbox.html">setbbox</a>, pathbbox returns a result
		derived from that bounding box, not from the actual path.
