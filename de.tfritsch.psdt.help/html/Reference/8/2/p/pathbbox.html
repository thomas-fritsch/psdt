	<h3>pathbbox</h3>
	<pre>- <b>pathbbox</b> ll<sub>x</sub> ll<sub>y</sub> ur<sub>x</sub> ur<sub>y</sub></pre>
	<p>
		returns the bounding box of the current path, the smallest rectangle
		enclosing all elements of the path. The results are four real numbers
		describing a rectangle in user space, oriented with its sides parallel
		to the axes of the user coordinate system: <i>ll<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>ll<sub>y</sub></i>
		are the coordinates of the rectangle's lower-left corner, <i>ur<sub>x</sub></i>
		and <i>ur<sub>y</sub></i> the upper-right corner. If the current path
		is empty, <b>pathbbox</b> executes the error <a
			href="../n/nocurrentpoint.html">nocurrentpoint</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If an explicit bounding box has been established with the <a
			href="../s/setbbox.html">setbbox</a> operator, <b>pathbbox</b>
		returns a result derived from that bounding box rather than from the
		actual path. Otherwise, <b>pathbbox</b> first computes the bounding
		box of the current path in device space. It then transforms the
		corners of this box from device to user coordinates, by applying the
		inverse of the current transformation matrix, and constructs the
		smallest rectangle in user space that is oriented parallel to the user
		space axes and encloses all four corners of the resulting figure. If
		the user coordinate system is rotated (other than by a multiple of 90
		degrees) or skewed, the bounding box returned may be larger than
		expected.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the current path includes curve segments, the computed bounding box
		will enclose the curves' control points as well as the curves
		themselves. A bounding box fitting the path more tightly can be
		obtained by first "flattening" the curve segments with the<a
			href="../f/flattenpath.html">flattenpath</a> operator.
	</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 2 or 3, if the current path ends with a <a
			href="../m/moveto.html">moveto</a> operation, the coordinates of the
		<a href="../m/moveto.html">moveto</a> are not considered during the
		computation of the bounding box unless the <a href="../m/moveto.html">moveto</a>
		is the only element of the path.
