	<b>put</b>
	<pre> array index any <b>put</b> -
    dict key any <b>put</b> -
string index int <b>put</b> -</pre>
	<p>replaces a single element of the value of an array, dictionary,
		or string.</p>
	<p>
		If the first operand is an array or string, put treats the second
		operand as an index and stores the third operand at the position
		identified by the index, counting from zero. index must be in the
		range 0 to n-1,where n is the length of the array or string. If it is
		outside this range, put will execute a <a href="../r/rangecheck.html">rangecheck</a>
		error.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the first operand is a dictionary, put uses the second operand as a
		key and the third operand as a value, and it stores this key-value
		pair into dict. If key is already present as a key in dict, put simply
		replaces its value by any. Otherwise, put creates a new entry for key
		and associates any with it. In Level 1 implementations, if dict is
		already full, put executes the error <a href="../d/dictfull.html">dictfull</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the value of array or dict is in global VM and any is a composite
		object whose value is in local VM, an <a
			href="../i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a> error occurs.
