	<h3>7.1 Multiple Execution Contexts</h3>
	<p>The Display PostScript system can support multiple, concurrent
		execution contexts. Each context has an environment consisting of
		stacks, local and global VM, graphics state, and certain variables,
		such as VM allocation mode and array packing mode. Except for VM, a
		contextâ€™s environment is entirely private to that context and is never
		visible to any other context. Under suitable conditions, a context's
		VM can be shared with other contexts.</p>
