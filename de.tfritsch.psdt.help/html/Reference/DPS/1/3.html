	<h3>7.1.3 Context Synchronization</h3>
	<p>When multiple contexts share objects in a single VM, they
		require a way to synchronize their activities. To facilitate this, the
		language includes two special types of synchronization objects and
		several operators for manipulating them.</p>
	<p>
		A <i>lock</i> is a semaphore for mutual exclusion. Cooperating
		contexts can use it to guard against concurrent access to data that
		they are sharing. A context acquires a lock before accessing the data
		and releases it afterward. During that time, other contexts are
		prevented from acquiring the lock&mdash;they cannot access the data
		when it is in a possibly inconsistent state. The association between a
		lock object and the data protected by the lock is entirely a matter of
		programming convention.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <i>condition</i> is a binary semaphore that cooperating contexts can
		use to synchronize their activity. One or more contexts can wait on a
		condition&mdash;in other words, suspend execution for an arbitrary
		length of time until notified by another context that the condition
		has been satisfied. Once again, the association between the condition
		object and the event or state it represents is a matter of programming
		convention.
	</p>
	<p>
		The objects <i>lock</i> and <i>condition</i> are distinct types of
		objects, created by the operators <a href="../../8/2/l/lock.html">lock</a>
		and <a href="../../c/condition.html">condition</a>, respectively. They
		are composite objects in the sense that their values occupy space in
		VM separate from the objects themselves. When a lock or condition
		object is stored in multiple places, all the instances share the same
		value. However, the values of locks and conditions can be accessed
		only by the synchronization operators.
	</p>
	<p>
		Locks and conditions are ordinarily used together in a stylized way.
		The <a href="../../8/2/m/monitor.html">monitor</a> operator acquires a
		lock (waiting if necessary), executes an arbitrary PostScript language
		procedure, then releases the lock. The <a href="../../8/2/w/wait.html">wait</a>
		operator is executed within a procedure invoked by monitor. It
		releases the lock, waits for the condition to be satisfied, and
		reacquires the lock. The <a href="../../8/2/n/notify.html">notify</a>
		operator indicates that a condition has been satisfied and resumes any
		contexts waiting on that condition.
	</p>
	<p>
		The recommended style of use of <a href="../../8/2/w/wait.html">wait</a>
		and <a href="../../8/2/n/notify.html">notify</a> is based on the
		notion that a context first waits for a shared data structure to reach
		some desired state, then performs some computation based on that
		state, and finally alerts other contexts of any changes it has made to
		the data. A lock and a condition are used to implement this protocol.
		The lock protects against concurrent access to the data; the condition
		is used to notify other contexts that some potentially interesting
		change has occurred.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Locks and conditions are treated separately
			because one may want to have several conditions that represent
			different states of the same shared data.</i>
	</p>
	<p>This protocol is illustrated by the following two program
		fragments, which are likely to be executed by different contexts.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 7.1</b>
	</p>
	<pre>/lock1 lock def
/cond1 condition def

lock1 {
  {
    <i>... boolean expression testing monitored data ...</i>
    {exit} {lock1 cond1 wait} ifelse
  } loop
   <i>... computation involving monitored data ...</i>
} monitor</pre>
	<p>
		<b>Example 7.2</b>
	</p>
	<pre>lock1 {
  <i>... computation that changes monitored data ...</i>
  cond1 notify
} monitor</pre>
	<p>
		Example 7.1 executes <a href="../../8/2/m/monitor.html">monitor</a> to
		acquire the lock named lock1; it must do so to safely access the
		shared data associated with it. The program then checks whether the <i>boolean
			expression</i> has become <i>true</i>; it waits on the condition named
		cond1 (repeatedly, if necessary) until the expression evaluates to <i>true</i>.
		Now, while still holding the lock, it performs some <i>computation</i>
		based on this state of the shared data. It might alter the data in
		such a way that the <i>boolean expression</i> would evaluate <i>false</i>.
		Finally, it releases lock1 by leaving the procedure invoked by <a
			href="../../8/2/m/monitor.html">monitor</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Example 7.2 acquires lock1 and then performs some computation that
		alters the data in a way that might favorably affect the outcome of
		the <i>boolean expression</i>. It then notifies cond1 and releases
		lock1. If there is a context suspended at the <a
			href="../../8/2/w/wait.html">wait</a> in Example 7.1, it now resumes
		and gets another chance to evaluate the <i>boolean expression</i>. (If
		multiple contexts are waiting for cond1, the <a
			href="../../8/2/n/notify.html">notify</a> resumes all of them;
		however, only one context at a time gets to acquire lock1.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that it is unsafe to assume that the state tested by the <i>boolean
			expression</i> is <i>true</i> immediately after resumption from a <a
			href="../../8/2/w/wait.html">wait</a>. Even if it was <i>true</i> at
		the moment of the <a href="../../8/2/n/notify.html">notify</a>, it
		might have become <i>false</i> due to intervening execution by some
		other context. Notifying cond1 does not certify that the value of the
		<i>boolean expression</i> is <i>true</i>, only that it might be <i>true</i>.
		Programs that conform to this protocol are immune from deadlocks due
		to "lost notifies" or malfunctions due to "extra notifies."
	</p>
	<p>A program must not make any assumptions regarding context
		scheduling. In some environments, the PostScript interpreter switches
		control among contexts pre-emptively and at any time; therefore,
		program execution in different contexts may be interleaved
		arbitrarily. Pre-emption may occur within a single operator, such as
		one that causes a PostScript language procedure to be executed or that
		reads or writes a file. To ensure predictable behavior, contexts must
		use the synchronization primitives to control access to shared data.</p>
	<p>In any environment that supports concurrent execution of
		independent threads of control, there is the possibility of deadlock.
		The most familiar form of deadlock occurs among two or more contexts
		when each waits for a notification from the other or each attempts to
		acquire a lock already held by the other. Another deadlock situation
		arises when all available communication buffers become filled with
		data for a context that is waiting for notification from some other
		context, but the other context cannot proceed because it has no way to
		communicate. Such deadlocks can be avoided only through careful system
		and application design.</p>
	<p>The synchronization primitives can be used to synchronize access
		to shared data in either local or global VM. Of course, this requires
		prearrangement among all contexts involved; the lock and condition
		objects used for this purpose should be in the same VM as the data
		being shared.</p>
