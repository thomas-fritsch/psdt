	<h3>7.1.1 Creating Contexts</h3>
	<p>
		Applications normally access the Display PostScript system through the
		<i>Client Library</i>, which includes procedures for creating,
		communicating with, and destroying PostScript execution contexts. The
		Client Library facilities are not part of the PostScript language
		definition; they are described in the <i>Display PostScript System
			Reference Manual</i>.
	</p>
	<p>When an application creates a context, it chooses whether the
		context is to share VM with some other existing context. The choices
		are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Local and global VM are completely private to the context.</li>
		<li>Local VM is private to the context, but global VM is shared
			with some other context.</li>
		<li>Local and global VM are shared with some other context.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The Client Library procedure that creates a context provides a means
		to specify how the new context's VM is to be set up and which other
		context's VM, if any, it is to share. A PostScript language program
		can also create a context by executing the <a
			href="../../8/2/f/fork.html">fork</a> operator, which always uses
		method 3.
	</p>
	<p>
		Method 1 creates a context that is completely isolated from other
		contexts. The context has its own private <a
			href="../../8/2/u/userdict.html">userdict</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/g/globaldict.html">globaldict</a>, and other standard
		dictionaries, all of which have their standard initial contents. A
		context that is to operate as a "job server," supporting the
		encapsulated job model described in section <a href="../../3/7/7.html">3.7.7,
			"Job Execution Environment,"</a> must be created by method 1, because the
		semantics of job encapsulation conflict with the semantics of shared
		VM.
	</p>
	<p>
		Method 2 creates a context with its own private local VM but sharing
		the global VM of one or more other contexts. In other words, objects
		in local VM, such as <a href="../../8/2/u/userdict.html">userdict</a>,
		are private to the context; objects in global VM, such as <a
			href="../../8/2/g/globaldict.html">globaldict</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/g/GlobalFontDirectory.html">GlobalFontDirectory</a>,
		are shared with the other contexts. When one context modifies the
		value of a global object, the effect is immediately visible to the
		other contexts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Method 3 creates a context that shares both the local VM and the
		global VM of one or more other contexts. When one context modifies the
		value of <i>any</i> object in VM, the effect is immediately visible to
		the other contexts.
	</p>
