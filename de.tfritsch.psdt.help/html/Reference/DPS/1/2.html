	<h3>7.1.2 Context Operators</h3>
	<p>
		For the context operators, a <i>context</i> is an integer that
		identifies a PostScript execution context. Each context has a unique
		identifier, whether it was created by calling a Client Library
		procedure or by executing the <a href="../../8/2/f/fork.html">fork</a>
		operator. This integer identifies the context during communication
		between the application and the Display PostScript system, and during
		execution of the <a href="../../8/2/j/join.html">join</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/d/detach.html">detach</a> operators. Identifiers for
		contexts that have terminated become invalid and are not reused during
		the lifetime of any currently active session. The <a
			href="../../8/2/c/currentcontext.html">currentcontext</a> operator
		returns the identifier for the context that is executing.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/f/fork.html">fork</a> operator creates a new
		context that shares the local and global VM of the context that
		executes <a href="../../8/2/f/fork.html">fork</a>. One of the operands
		to <a href="../../8/2/f/fork.html">fork</a> is a procedure the new
		context is to execute. The remaining operands are used to initialize
		the new context's operand stack.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/j/join.html">join</a> operator waits for a
		context that was previously created by <a href="../../8/2/f/fork.html">fork</a>
		to return from its top-level procedure. It then copies that context's
		operand stack to the caller's operand stack and destroys the context.
		If there is no need for the context to return results when it
		terminates, it can declare this by means of the <a
			href="../../8/2/d/detach.html">detach</a> operator.
	</p>
	<p>
		A context can <i>suspend</i> its own execution by any of a variety of
		means: execute the <a href="../../8/2/w/wait.html">wait</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/m/monitor.html">monitor</a>, or <a
			href="../../8/2/y/yield.html">yield</a> operators (described below)
		or return from its top-level procedure to await a <a
			href="../../8/2/j/join.html">join</a>. The context retains the state
		it had at the moment of suspension and can ordinarily be resumed from
		the point of suspension.
	</p>
	<p>
		A context can <i>terminate</i> by executing the quit operator or as a
		result of an explicit termination request from the Client Library.
		Termination also occurs if an error occurs that is not caught by an
		explicit use of <a href="../../8/2/s/stopped.html">stopped</a>. When a
		context terminates, its stacks are destroyed, its standard input and
		output files are closed, and its context identifier becomes invalid.
	</p>
	<p>There is no hierarchical relationship among contexts.
		Termination of a context has no effect on other contexts that it may
		have created. An integer that identifies a context has the same
		meaning in every context;</p>
	<p>
		An <a href="../../8/2/i/invalidcontext.html">invalidcontext</a> error
		occurs if an invalid context identifier is presented to any of the
		context operators or if certain other improper conditions are
		detected. See section <a href="4.html">7.1.4, "Programming
			Restrictions."</a>
