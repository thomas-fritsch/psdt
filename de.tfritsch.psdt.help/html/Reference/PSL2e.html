<B>eexec</B> file eexec <BR>
string eexec - <BR>
<BR>
causes the contents of file (open for reading) or string to be decrypted
and then executed in a manner similar to the exec operator. The decryption
operation does not cause the file or string to be modified. <BR>
<BR>
eexec creates a new file object that serves as a decryption filter on the
specified file or string. It pushes the new file object on the execution
stack, making it the current file for the PostScript interpreter. Subsequently,
each time the interpreter reads a character from this file, or a program
reads explicitly from currentfile, the decryption filter reads one character
from the original file or string and decrypts it. <BR>
<BR>
The decryption filter file is closed automatically when the end of the original
file or string is encountered. It may also be closed explicitly by <A HREF="PSL2c.html#closefile">closefile</A>.
If the file passed to eexec was <A HREF="PSL2c.html#currentfile">currentfile</A>,
this resumes direct execution of that file with the decryption filter removed.
The file may consist of encrypted text followed by unencrypted text if the
last thing executed in the encrypted text is currentfile closefile. <BR>
<BR>
Before beginning execution, eexec pushes <A HREF="PSL2s.html#systemdict">systemdict</A>
on the dictionary stack. This ensures that the operators executed by the
encrypted program have their standard meanings. When the decryption filter
file is closed either explicitly or implicitly, the dictionary stack is
popped. The program must be aware that it is being executed with <A HREF="PSL2s.html#systemdict">systemdict</A>
as the current dictionary; in particular, any definitions that it makes
must be into a specific dictionary rather than the current one, since <A HREF="PSL2s.html#systemdict">systemdict</A>
is read-only. <BR>
<BR>
The encrypted file may be represented in either binary or hex; the eexec
operator can decrypt it without being told which type it is. The recommended
representation is hex, because hex data can be transmitted through communication
channels that are not completely transparent. Regardless of the representation
of the encrypted file, the encryption and decryption processes are transparent.
That is, an arbitrary binary file can be encrypted, transmitted as either
binary or hex, and decrypted to yield<BR>
the original information. <BR>
<BR>
The encryption employed by eexec is intended primarily for use in Type 1
font programs. The book Adobe Type 1 Font Format contains a complete description
of the encryption algorithm and recommended uses of eexec.<BR>

<B>eq</B> any1 any2 eq bool <BR>
<BR>
pops two objects from the operand stack and pushes the boolean value <A HREF="PSL2t.html#true">true</A>
if they are equal, <A HREF="PSL2f.html#false">false</A> if not. The definition
of equality depends on the types of the objects being compared. Simple objects
are equal if their types and values are the same. Strings are equal if their
lengths and individual elements are equal. Other composite objects (arrays
and dictionaries) are equal only if they share the same value. Separate
values are considered unequal, even if all the components of those values
are the same. <BR>
<BR>
Some type conversions are performed by eq. Integers and reals can be compared
freely: An integer and a real representing the same mathematical value are
considered equal by eq. Strings and names can likewise be compared freely:
A name defined by some sequence of characters is equal to a string whose
elements are the same sequence of characters. <BR>
<BR>
The literal/executable and access attributes of objects are not considered
in comparisons between objects. <BR>
<BR>

4.0 4 eq -&gt; true % A real and an integer may be equal <BR>
(abc) (abc) eq -&gt; true % Strings with equal elements are equal<BR>

<B>erasepage</B> - erasepage - <BR>
<BR>
% different in the NeXT implementation<BR>
<BR>
This standard PostScript operator has the following effect in the NeXT implementation
of the Display PostScript system: It erases the entire window to opaque
white.<BR>
<BR>
erases the entire current page by painting it with gray level 1, which is
ordinarily white, but may be some other color if an atypical transfer function
has been defined. The entire page is erased, regardless of the clip path
currently in force. erasepage affects only the contents of raster memory.
It does not modify the graphics state nor does it cause a page to be transmitted
to the output device. <BR>
<BR>
erasepage is executed automatically by <A HREF="PSL2s.html#showpage">showpage</A>
after imaging. There are few situations in which a PostScript language page
description should execute erasepage explicitly, because the operator affects
portions of the current page outside the current clip path. It is usually
more appropriate to erase just the inside of the current clip path (see
<A HREF="PSL2c.html#clippath">clippath</A>). Then the page description can
be embedded within another, composite page without undesirable effects.

<HR><A NAME="exec"></A><BR>
<B>exec</B> any exec - <BR>
<BR>
pushes the operand on the execution stack, executing it immediately. The
effect of executing an object depends on the object's type and literal/executable
attribute. In particular, executing a literal object will cause it only
to be pushed back on the operand stack. Executing a procedure, however,
will cause the procedure to be called. <BR>
<BR>
EXAMPLE:<BR>
(3 2 add) cvx exec -&gt; 5 <BR>
3 2 /add exec -&gt; 3 2 /add <BR>
3 2 /add cvx exec -&gt; 5 <BR>
<BR>
In the first line, the string (3 2 add) is made executable and then executed.
Executing a string causes its characters to be scanned and interpreted according
to the PostScript language syntax rules. <BR>
<BR>
In the second line, the literal objects 3, 2, and /add are pushed on the
operand stack, then exec is applied to the add. Since the add is a literal
name, executing it simply causes it to be pushed back on the operand stack.
The exec in this case has no useful effect.<BR>
<BR>
In the third line, the literal name /add on the top of the operand stack
is made executable by <A HREF="PSL2c.html#cvx">cvx</A>. Applying exec to
this executable name causes it to be looked up and the add operation to
be performed.<BR>

<HR><A NAME="execform"></A><BR>
<B>execform</B> form execform - LEVEL 2 <BR>
<BR>
paints a form specified by a form dictionary . The graphical output produced
by execform is defined by the form dictionary's PaintProc procedure. <BR>
<BR>
If this is the first invocation of execform for form, execform first verifies
that the dictionary contains the required entries. Then it adds an entry
to the dictionary with the key Implementation, whose value is private to
the implementation. Finally, it makes the dictionary read-only. (execform
performs these alterations directly to the operand dictionary; it does not
copy the dictionary.) <BR>
<BR>
When execform needs to call the PaintProc procedure, it pushes the form
dictionary on the operand stack, then executes the equivalent of<BR>
<BR>
gsave % Operand stack: dict<BR>
dup /Matrix get concat<BR>
dup /BBox get aload pop % Stack: dict llx lly urx ury<BR>
exch 3 index sub<BR>
exch 2 index sub % Stack: dict llx lly width height<BR>
rectclip % Also does a newpath<BR>
dup /PaintProc get % Stack: dict proc<BR>
exec % Execute PaintProc with dict on stack<BR>
grestore <BR>
<BR>
The PaintProc procedure is expected to consume the dictionary operand and
to execute a sequence of graphics operators to paint the form. The PaintProc
must always produce the same output, given the same graphics state parameters,
independent of the number of times it is called and independent, for example,
of the contents of userdict. The PostScript language program should not
expect any particular execution of execform to cause execution of the specified
PaintProc. <BR>
<BR>
The documented errors are those produced directly by execform. Obviously,
the PaintProc can cause other errors. <BR>

error will result), but it can still be executed by the PostScript interpreter-for
example, by invoking it with exec. <BR>

a looping context without regard to lexical relationship. A looping context

exit pops the execution stack down to the level of that operator. The interpreter
then resumes execution at the next object in normal sequence after that
operator. <BR>

exit does not affect the operand or dictionary stacks. Any objects pushed
on those stacks during execution of the looping context remain after the
context is exited. <BR>

If exit would escape from the context of a <A HREF="PSL2qr.html#run">run</A>

error (still in the context of the <A HREF="PSL2qr.html#run">run</A> or <A HREF="PSL2s.html#stopped">stopped</A>).
If there is no enclosing looping context, the interpreter prints an error
message and executes the built-in operator <A HREF="PSL2qr.html#quit">quit</A>.

are enclosed by a <A HREF="PSL2s.html#stopped">stopped</A> context. <BR>
