	<h3>Numbers</h3>
	<p>Numbers in the PostScript language include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Signed integers, such as <pre>123 -98 43445 0 +17</pre></li>
		<li>Real numbers, such as<pre>-.002 34.5 -3.62 123.6e10 1.0E-5 1E6 -1. 0.0</pre></li>
		<li>Radix numbers, such as<pre>8#1777 16#FFFE 2#1000</pre></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		An integer consists of an optional sign followed by one or more
		decimal digits. The number is interpreted as a signed decimal integer
		and is converted to an integer object. If it exceeds the
		implementation limit for integers, it is converted to a real object.
		(See <a href="../../../B.html">Appendix B</a> for implementation
		limits.)
	</p>
	<p>
		A real number consists of an optional sign and one or more decimal
		digits, with an embedded period (decimal point), a trailing exponent,
		or both. The exponent, if present, consists of the letter E or e
		followed by an optional sign and one or more decimal digits. The
		number is interpreted as a real number and is converted to a real
		(floating-point) object. If it exceeds the implementation limit for
		real numbers, a <a href="../../../8/2/l/limitcheck.html">limitcheck</a>
		error occurs.
	</p>
	<p>
		A radix number takes the form base#number, where base is a decimal
		integer in the range 2 through 36. number is interpreted in this base;
		it must consist of digits ranging from 0 to base - 1. Digits greater
		than 9 are represented by the letters A through Z (or a through z).
		The number is treated as an unsigned integer and is converted to an
		integer object having the same twos-complement binary representation.
		This notation is intended for specifying integers in a nondecimal
		radix, such as binary, octal, or hexadecimal. If the number exceeds
		the implementation limit for integers, a <a
			href="../../../8/2/l/limitcheck.html">limitcheck</a> error occurs.
