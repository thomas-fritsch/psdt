	<h3>Names</h3>
	<p>
		Any token that consists entirely of regular characters and cannot be
		interpreted as a number is treated as a <em>name</em> object (more
		precisely, an <em>executable</em> name). All characters except
		delimiters and white-space characters can appear in names, including
		characters ordinarily considered to be punctuation.
	</p>
	<p>The following are examples of valid names:</p>
	<pre>abc Offset $$ 23A 13-456 a.b $MyDict @pattern</pre>
	<p>Use care when choosing names that begin with digits. For
		example, while 23A is a valid name, 23E1 is a real number, and 23#1 is
		a radix number token that represents an integer.</p>
	<p>
		A / (slash&mdash;<em>not</em> backslash) introduces a literal name.
		The slash is not part of the name itself, but is a prefix indicating
		that the following sequence of zero or more regular characters
		constitutes a literal name object. There can be no white-space
		characters between the / and the name. The characters // (two slashes)
		introduce an <em>immediately evaluated name</em>. The important
		properties and uses of names and the distinction between executable
		and literal names are described in Section <a href="../../3.html">3.3,
			"Data Types and Objects"</a>; immediately evaluated names are discussed
		in Section <a href="../../12/2.html">3.12.2, "Immediately
			Evaluated Names."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<em><b>Note:</b> The token / (a slash followed by no regular
			characters) is a valid literal name.</em>
