	<h3>Procedures</h3>
	<p>
		The special characters { and } delimit an <em>executable array</em>,
		otherwise known as a <em>procedure</em>. The syntax is superficially
		similar to that for the array construction operators [ and ]; however,
		the semantics are entirely different and arise as a result of <em>scanning</em>
		the procedure rather than <em>executing</em> it.
	</p>
	<p>Scanning the program fragment</p>
	<pre>{add 2 div}</pre>
	<p>
		produces a single procedure object that contains the name object <b>add</b>,
		the integer object 2, and the name object <b>div</b>. When the scanner
		encounters the initial {, it continues scanning and creating objects,
		but the interpreter does not execute them. When the scanner encounters
		the matching }, it puts all the objects created since the initial {
		into a new executable array (procedure) object.
	</p>
	<p>
		The interpreter does not execute a procedure immediately, but treats
		it as data; it pushes the procedure on the operand stack. Only when
		the procedure is explicitly invoked (by means yet to be described)
		will it be executed. Execution of the procedure&mdash; and of all
		objects within the procedure, including any embedded procedures&mdash;
		has been <em>deferred</em>. The matter of immediate versus deferred
		execution is discussed in Section <a href="../../5.html">3.5,
			"Execution."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The procedure object created by { and } is either an array or a packed
		array, according to the current setting of a mode switch. The
		distinction between these array types is discussed in Section <a
			href="../../3.html">3.3, "Data Types and Objects."</a>
