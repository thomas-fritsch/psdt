	<h3>Dictionaries</h3>
	<p>
		The special character sequences &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; <em>(LanguageLevel
			2)</em> are self-delimiting tokens that denote the construction of a
		dictionary, much the same as [ and ] denote the construction of an
		array. They are intended to be used as follows:
	</p>
	<pre>&lt;&lt; <em>key<sub>1</sub> value<sub>1</sub> key<sub>2</sub>value<sub>2</sub> ... key<sub>n</sub> value<sub>n</sub></em> &gt;&gt;</pre>
	<p>
		This creates a dictionary containing the bracketed key-value pairs and
		pushes it on the operand stack. Dictionaries are introduced in Section
		<a href="../../3.html">3.3, "Data Types and Objects."</a>
	</p>
	<p>The &lt;&lt; and >> tokens are self-delimiting, so they need not
		be surrounded by white-space characters or other delimiters. Do not
		confuse these tokens with &lt; and >, which delimit a hexadecimal
		string literal, or &lt;<~ and ~&gt;, which delimit an ASCII base-85
		string literal. The &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; tokens are objects in their
		own right (specifically, name objects), whereas in &lt; ... &gt; and
		&lt;~ ... ~&gt; the delimiting characters are merely punctuation for
		the enclosed literal string objects.</p>
