	<h3>Comments</h3>
	<p>
		Any occurrence of the character % outside a string introduces a <em>comment</em>.
		The comment consists of all characters between the % and the next
		newline or form feed, including regular, delimiter, space, and tab
		characters.
	</p>
	<p>The scanner ignores comments, treating each one as if it were a
		single whitespace character. That is, a comment separates the token
		preceding it from the one following. Thus the ASCII-encoded program
		fragment</p>
	<pre>
abc% comment {/%) blah blah blah
123</pre>
	<p>is treated by the scanner as just two tokens: abc and 123.</p>
