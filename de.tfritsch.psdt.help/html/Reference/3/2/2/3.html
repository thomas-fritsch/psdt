	<h3>Strings</h3>
	<p>There are three conventions for quoting a literal string object:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>As literal text, enclosed in ( and )</li>
		<li>As hexadecimal data, enclosed in &lt; and &gt;</li>
		<li>As ASCII base-85 data, enclosed in &lt;~ and ~&gt; <em>(LanguageLevel
				2)</em></li>
	</ul>
	<h4 id="1">Literal Text Strings</h4>
	<p>A literal text string consists of an arbitrary number of
		characters enclosed in ( and ). Any characters may appear in the
		string other than (, ), and \, which must be treated specially.
		Balanced pairs of parentheses in the string require no special
		treatment.</p>
	<p>The following lines show several valid strings:</p>
	<pre>
(This is a string)
(Strings may contain newlines
and such.)
(Strings may contain special characters *!&amp;}^% and
balanced parentheses ( ) (and so on).)
(The following is an empty string.)
()
(It has 0 (zero) length.)</pre>
	<p>Within a text string, the \ (backslash) character is treated as
		an "escape" for various purposes, such as including newline
		characters, unbalanced parentheses, and the \ character itself in the
		string. The character immediately following the \ determines its
		precise interpretation.</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>\n</td>
			<td>line feed (LF)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\r</td>
			<td>carriage return (CR)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\t</td>
			<td>horizontal tab</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\b</td>
			<td>backspace</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\f</td>
			<td>form feed</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\\</td>
			<td>backslash</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\(</td>
			<td>left parenthesis</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\)</td>
			<td>right parenthesis</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\<em>ddd</em></td>
			<td>character code <em>ddd</em> (octal)
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>If the character following the \ is not in the preceding list,
		the scanner ignores the \. If the \ is followed immediately by a
		newline (CR, LF, or CR-LF pair), the scanner ignores both the initial
		\ and the newline; this breaks a string into multiple lines without
		including the newline character as part of the string, as in the
		following example:</p>
	<pre>
(These \
two strings \
are the same.)
(These two strings are the same.)</pre>
	<p>But if a newline appears without a preceding \, the result is
		equivalent to \n. For example:</p>
	<pre>
(This string has a newline at the end of it.
)
(So does this one.\n)</pre>
	<p>
		For more information about end-of-line conventions, see Section <a
			href="../../8.html">3.8, "File Input and Output."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <em>\ddd</em> form may be used to include any 8-bit character
		constant in a string. One, two, or three octal digits may be
		specified, with high-order overflow ignored. This notation is
		preferred for specifying a character outside the recommended ASCII
		character set for the PostScript language, since the notation itself
		stays within the standard set and thereby avoids possible difficulties
		in transmitting or storing the text of the program. It is recommended
		that three octal digits always be used, with leading zeros as needed,
		to prevent ambiguity. The string (\0053), for example, contains two
		characters&mdash;an ASCII 5 (Control-E) followed by the digit
		3&mdash;whereas the strings (\53) and (\053) contain one character,
		the ASCII character whose code is octal 53 (plus sign).
	</p>
	<h4 id="2">Hexadecimal Strings</h4>
	<p>
		A hexadecimal string consists of a sequence of hexadecimal digits (0-9
		and either A-F or a-f) enclosed within &lt; and &gt;. Each pair of
		hexadecimal digits defines one character of the string. White-space
		characters are ignored. If a hexadecimal string contains characters
		outside the allowed character set, a <b>syntaxerror</b> occurs.
		Hexadecimal strings are useful for including arbitrary binary data as
		literal text.
	</p>
	<p>If the final digit of a given hexadecimal string is
		missing&mdash;in other words, if there is an odd number of
		digits&mdash;the final digit is assumed to be 0. For example,
		&lt;901fa3&gt; is a 3-character string containing the characters whose
		hexadecimal codes are 90, 1f, and a3, but &lt;901fa&gt; is a
		3-character string containing the characters whose hexadecimal codes
		are 90, 1f, and a0.</p>
	<h4 id="3">ASCII Base-85 Strings</h4>
	<p>
		An ASCII base-85 string <em>(LanguageLevel 2)</em> consists of a
		sequence of printable ASCII characters enclosed in &lt;~ and ~&gt;.
		This notation represents arbitrary binary data using an encoding
		technique that produces a 4:5 expansion as opposed to the 1:2
		expansion for hexadecimal. The ASCII base-85 encoding algorithm is
		described under <a href="../../13/3.html#4">"ASCII85Encode Filter" on
			page 131</a>. If an ASCII base-85 string is malformed, a <a
			href="../../../8/2/s/syntaxerror.html">syntaxerror</a> occurs.
