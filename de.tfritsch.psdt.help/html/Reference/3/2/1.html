	<h2>3.2.1 Scanner</h2>
	<p>
		The PostScript language differs from most other programming languages
		in that it does not have any syntactic entity for a "program," nor is
		it necessary for an entire "program" to exist in one place at one
		time. There is no notion of "reading in" a program before executing
		it. Instead, the PostScript interpreter <em>consumes</em> a program by
		reading and executing one syntactic entity at a time. From the
		interpreter’s point of view, the program has no permanent existence.
		Execution of the program may have side effects in the interpreter’s
		memory or elsewhere. These side effects may include the creation of
		procedure objects in memory that are intended to be invoked later in
		the program; their execution is <em>deferred</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is not correct to think that the PostScript interpreter "executes"
		the character stream directly. Rather, a scanner groups characters
		into tokens according to the PostScript language syntax rules. It then
		assembles one or more tokens to create a PostScript <em>object</em>&mdash;in
		other words, a data value in the interpreter's memory. Finally, the
		interpreter executes the object.
	</p>
	<p>For example, when the scanner encounters a group of consecutive
		digits surrounded by spaces or other separators, it assembles the
		digits into a token and then converts the token into a number object
		represented internally as a binary integer. The interpreter then
		executes this number object; in this case, it pushes a copy of the
		object on the operand stack.</p>
