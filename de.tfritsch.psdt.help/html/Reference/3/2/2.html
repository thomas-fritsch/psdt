	<h2>3.2.2 ASCII Encoding</h2>
	<p>The standard character set for ASCII-encoded PostScript programs
		is the visible printable subset of the ASCII character set, plus
		characters that appear as "white space," such as space, tab, and
		newline characters. ASCII is the American Standard Code for
		Information Interchange, a widely used convention for encoding
		characters as binary numbers. ASCII encoding does not prohibit the use
		of characters outside this set, but such use is not recommended,
		because it impairs portability and may make transmission and storage
		of PostScript programs more difficult.</p>
	<p>
		<em><b>Note:</b> Control characters are often usurped by
			communications functions. Control codes are device-dependent—not part
			of the PostScript language. For example, the serial communication
			protocol supported by many products uses the Control-D character as
			an end-of-file indication. In such cases, Control-D is a
			communications function and should not be part of a PostScript
			program.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>White-space characters</em> (Table 3.1) separate syntactic
		constructs such as names and numbers from each other. The interpreter
		treats any number of consecutive white-space characters as if there
		were just one. All white-space characters are equivalent, except in
		comments and strings.
	</p>
	<p>The characters carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) are also
		called newline characters. The combination of a carriage return
		followed immediately by a line feed is treated as one newline.</p>

	<p>The characters (, ), &lt;, &gt;, [, ], {, }, /, and % are
		special. They delimit syntactic entities such as strings, procedure
		bodies, name literals, and comments. Any of these characters
		terminates the entity preceding it and is not included in the entity.</p>
	<p>
		All characters besides the white-space characters and delimiters are
		referred to as <em>regular characters</em>. These include nonprinting
		characters that are outside the recommended PostScript ASCII character
		set.
	</p>
	<h3 id="1">Comments</h3>
	<p>
		Any occurrence of the character % outside a string introduces a <em>comment</em>.
		The comment consists of all characters between the % and the next
		newline or form feed, including regular, delimiter, space, and tab
		characters.
	</p>
	<p>The scanner ignores comments, treating each one as if it were a
		single whitespace character. That is, a comment separates the token
		preceding it from the one following. Thus the ASCII-encoded program
		fragment</p>
	<pre>
    abc% comment {/%) blah blah blah
    123</pre>
	<p>is treated by the scanner as just two tokens: abc and 123.</p>
	<h3 id="2">Numbers</h3>
	<p>Numbers in the PostScript language include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Signed integers, such as <pre>123 -98 43445 0 +17</pre></li>
		<li>Real numbers, such as<pre>-.002 34.5 -3.62 123.6e10 1.0E-5 1E6 -1. 0.0</pre></li>
		<li>Radix numbers, such as<pre>8#1777 16#FFFE 2#1000</pre></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		An integer consists of an optional sign followed by one or more
		decimal digits. The number is interpreted as a signed decimal integer
		and is converted to an integer object. If it exceeds the
		implementation limit for integers, it is converted to a real object.
		(See <a href="../../B.html">Appendix B</a> for implementation limits.)
	</p>
	<p>
		A real number consists of an optional sign and one or more decimal
		digits, with an embedded period (decimal point), a trailing exponent,
		or both. The exponent, if present, consists of the letter E or e
		followed by an optional sign and one or more decimal digits. The
		number is interpreted as a real number and is converted to a real
		(floating-point) object. If it exceeds the implementation limit for
		real numbers, a <a href="../../8/2/l/limitcheck.html">limitcheck</a>
		error occurs.
	</p>
	<p>
		A radix number takes the form base#number, where base is a decimal
		integer in the range 2 through 36. number is interpreted in this base;
		it must consist of digits ranging from 0 to base - 1. Digits greater
		than 9 are represented by the letters A through Z (or a through z).
		The number is treated as an unsigned integer and is converted to an
		integer object having the same twos-complement binary representation.
		This notation is intended for specifying integers in a nondecimal
		radix, such as binary, octal, or hexadecimal. If the number exceeds
		the implementation limit for integers, a <a
			href="../../8/2/l/limitcheck.html">limitcheck</a> error occurs.
	</p>
	<h3 id="3">Strings</h3>
	<p>There are three conventions for quoting a literal string object:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>As literal text, enclosed in ( and )</li>
		<li>As hexadecimal data, enclosed in &lt; and &gt;</li>
		<li>As ASCII base-85 data, enclosed in &lt;~ and ~&gt; <em>(LanguageLevel
				2)</em></li>
	</ul>
	<h4 id="3.1">Literal Text Strings</h4>
	<p>A literal text string consists of an arbitrary number of
		characters enclosed in ( and ). Any characters may appear in the
		string other than (, ), and \, which must be treated specially.
		Balanced pairs of parentheses in the string require no special
		treatment.</p>
	<p>The following lines show several valid strings:</p>
	<pre>
        (This is a string)
        (Strings may contain newlines
        and such.)
        (Strings may contain special characters *!&amp;}^% and
        balanced parentheses ( ) (and so on).)
        (The following is an empty string.)
        ()
        (It has 0 (zero) length.)
		</pre>
	<p>Within a text string, the \ (backslash) character is treated as
		an "escape" for various purposes, such as including newline
		characters, unbalanced parentheses, and the \ character itself in the
		string. The character immediately following the \ determines its
		precise interpretation.</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>\n</td>
			<td>line feed (LF)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\r</td>
			<td>carriage return (CR)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\t</td>
			<td>horizontal tab</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\b</td>
			<td>backspace</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\f</td>
			<td>form feed</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\\</td>
			<td>backslash</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\(</td>
			<td>left parenthesis</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\)</td>
			<td>right parenthesis</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\<em>ddd</em></td>
			<td>character code <em>ddd</em> (octal)
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>If the character following the \ is not in the preceding list,
		the scanner ignores the \. If the \ is followed immediately by a
		newline (CR, LF, or CR-LF pair), the scanner ignores both the initial
		\ and the newline; this breaks a string into multiple lines without
		including the newline character as part of the string, as in the
		following example:</p>
	<pre>
        (These \
        two strings \
        are the same.)
        (These two strings are the same.)
    </pre>
	<p>But if a newline appears without a preceding \, the result is
		equivalent to \n. For example:</p>
	<pre>
        (This string has a newline at the end of it.
        )
        (So does this one.\n)
        </pre>
	<p>
		For more information about end-of-line conventions, see Section <a
			href="../8.html">3.8, "File Input and Output."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <em>\ddd</em> form may be used to include any 8-bit character
		constant in a string. One, two, or three octal digits may be
		specified, with high-order overflow ignored. This notation is
		preferred for specifying a character outside the recommended ASCII
		character set for the PostScript language, since the notation itself
		stays within the standard set and thereby avoids possible difficulties
		in transmitting or storing the text of the program. It is recommended
		that three octal digits always be used, with leading zeros as needed,
		to prevent ambiguity. The string (\0053), for example, contains two
		characters&mdash;an ASCII 5 (Control-E) followed by the digit
		3&mdash;whereas the strings (\53) and (\053) contain one character,
		the ASCII character whose code is octal 53 (plus sign).
	</p>
	<h4 id="3.2">Hexadecimal Strings</h4>
	<p>
		A hexadecimal string consists of a sequence of hexadecimal digits (0–9
		and either A–F or a–f) enclosed within &lt; and &gt;. Each pair of
		hexadecimal digits defines one character of the string. White-space
		characters are ignored. If a hexadecimal string contains characters
		outside the allowed character set, a <b>syntaxerror</b> occurs.
		Hexadecimal strings are useful for including arbitrary binary data as
		literal text.
	</p>
	<p>If the final digit of a given hexadecimal string is
		missing&mdash;in other words, if there is an odd number of
		digits&mdash;the final digit is assumed to be 0. For example,
		&lt;901fa3&gt; is a 3-character string containing the characters whose
		hexadecimal codes are 90, 1f, and a3, but &lt;901fa&gt; is a
		3-character string containing the characters whose hexadecimal codes
		are 90, 1f, and a0.</p>
	<h4 id="3.3">ASCII Base-85 Strings</h4>
	<p>
		An ASCII base-85 string <em>(LanguageLevel 2)</em> consists of a
		sequence of printable ASCII characters enclosed in &lt;~ and ~&gt;.
		This notation represents arbitrary binary data using an encoding
		technique that produces a 4:5 expansion as opposed to the 1:2
		expansion for hexadecimal. The ASCII base-85 encoding algorithm is
		described under <a href="../13/3.html#4">"ASCII85Encode Filter" on
			page 131</a>. If an ASCII base-85 string is malformed, a <a
			href="../../8/2/s/syntaxerror.html">syntaxerror</a> occurs.
	</p>

	<h3 id="4">Names</h3>
	<p>
		Any token that consists entirely of regular characters and cannot be
		interpreted as a number is treated as a <em>name</em> object (more
		precisely, an <em>executable</em> name). All characters except
		delimiters and white-space characters can appear in names, including
		characters ordinarily considered to be punctuation.
	</p>
	<p>The following are examples of valid names:</p>
	<pre>
    abc Offset $$ 23A 13-456 a.b $MyDict @pattern</pre>
	<p>Use care when choosing names that begin with digits. For
		example, while 23A is a valid name, 23E1 is a real number, and 23#1 is
		a radix number token that represents an integer.</p>
	<p>
		A / (slash&mdash;<em>not</em> backslash) introduces a literal name.
		The slash is not part of the name itself, but is a prefix indicating
		that the following sequence of zero or more regular characters
		constitutes a literal name object. There can be no white-space
		characters between the / and the name. The characters // (two slashes)
		introduce an <em>immediately evaluated name</em>. The important
		properties and uses of names and the distinction between executable
		and literal names are described in Section <a href="../3.html">3.3,
			"Data Types and Objects"</a>; immediately evaluated names are discussed
		in Section <a href="../12/2.html">3.12.2, "Immediately Evaluated
			Names."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<em><b>Note:</b> The token / (a slash followed by no regular
			characters) is a valid literal name.</em>
	</p>
	<h3 id="5">Arrays</h3>
	<p>The characters [ and ] are self-delimiting tokens that specify
		the construction of an array. For example, the program fragment</p>
	<pre>
    [ 123 /abc (xyz) ]</pre>
	<p>results in the construction of an array object containing the
		integer object 123, the literal name object abc, and the string object
		xyz. Each token within the brackets is executed in turn.</p>
	<p>The [ and ] characters are special syntax for names that, when
		executed, invoke PostScript operators that collect objects and
		construct an array containing them. Thus the example</p>
	<pre>
    [ 123 /abc (xyz) ]</pre>
	<p>contains these five tokens:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The name object [</li>
		<li>The integer object 123</li>
		<li>The literal name object abc</li>
		<li>The string object xyz</li>
		<li>The name object ]</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When the example is executed, a sixth object (the array) results
		from executing the [ and ] name objects.</p>
	<h3 id="6">Procedures</h3>
	<p>
		The special characters { and } delimit an <em>executable array</em>,
		otherwise known as a <em>procedure</em>. The syntax is superficially
		similar to that for the array construction operators [ and ]; however,
		the semantics are entirely different and arise as a result of <em>scanning</em>
		the procedure rather than <em>executing</em> it.
	</p>
	<p>Scanning the program fragment</p>
	<pre>
    {add 2 div}</pre>
	<p>
		produces a single procedure object that contains the name object <b>add</b>,
		the integer object 2, and the name object <b>div</b>. When the scanner
		encounters the initial {, it continues scanning and creating objects,
		but the interpreter does not execute them. When the scanner encounters
		the matching }, it puts all the objects created since the initial {
		into a new executable array (procedure) object.
	</p>
	<p>
		The interpreter does not execute a procedure immediately, but treats
		it as data; it pushes the procedure on the operand stack. Only when
		the procedure is explicitly invoked (by means yet to be described)
		will it be executed. Execution of the procedure&mdash; and of all
		objects within the procedure, including any embedded procedures&mdash;
		has been <em>deferred</em>. The matter of immediate versus deferred
		execution is discussed in Section <a href="../5.html">3.5,
			"Execution."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The procedure object created by { and } is either an array or a packed
		array, according to the current setting of a mode switch. The
		distinction between these array types is discussed in Section <a
			href="../3.html">3.3, "Data Types and Objects."</a>
	</p>
	<h3 id="7">Dictionaries</h3>
	<p>
		The special character sequences &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; <em>(LanguageLevel
			2)</em> are self-delimiting tokens that denote the construction of a
		dictionary, much the same as [ and ] denote the construction of an
		array. They are intended to be used as follows:
	</p>
	<p>
		&lt;&lt; <em>key<sub>1</sub> value<sub>1</sub> key<sub>2</sub>
			value<sub>2</sub> ... key<sub>n</sub> value<sub>n</sub></em> &gt;&gt;
	</p>
	<p>
		This creates a dictionary containing the bracketed key-value pairs and
		pushes it on the operand stack. Dictionaries are introduced in Section
		<a href="../3.html">3.3, "Data Types and Objects."</a>
	</p>
	<p>The &lt;&lt; and >> tokens are self-delimiting, so they need not
		be surrounded by white-space characters or other delimiters. Do not
		confuse these tokens with &lt; and >, which delimit a hexadecimal
		string literal, or &lt;<~ and ~&gt;, which delimit an ASCII base-85
		string literal. The &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; tokens are objects in their
		own right (specifically, name objects), whereas in &lt; ... &gt; and
		&lt;~ ... ~&gt; the delimiting characters are merely punctuation for
		the enclosed literal string objects.</p>
