	<h2>3.2.2 ASCII Encoding</h2>
	<p>The standard character set for ASCII-encoded PostScript programs
		is the visible printable subset of the ASCII character set, plus
		characters that appear as "white space," such as space, tab, and
		newline characters. ASCII is the American Standard Code for
		Information Interchange, a widely used convention for encoding
		characters as binary numbers. ASCII encoding does not prohibit the use
		of characters outside this set, but such use is not recommended,
		because it impairs portability and may make transmission and storage
		of PostScript programs more difficult.</p>
	<p>
		<em><b>Note:</b> Control characters are often usurped by
			communications functions. Control codes are device-dependentâ€”not part
			of the PostScript language. For example, the serial communication
			protocol supported by many products uses the Control-D character as
			an end-of-file indication. In such cases, Control-D is a
			communications function and should not be part of a PostScript
			program.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>White-space characters</em> (Table 3.1) separate syntactic
		constructs such as names and numbers from each other. The interpreter
		treats any number of consecutive white-space characters as if there
		were just one. All white-space characters are equivalent, except in
		comments and strings.
	</p>
	<p>The characters carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) are also
		called newline characters. The combination of a carriage return
		followed immediately by a line feed is treated as one newline.</p>

	<p>The characters (, ), &lt;, &gt;, [, ], {, }, /, and % are
		special. They delimit syntactic entities such as strings, procedure
		bodies, name literals, and comments. Any of these characters
		terminates the entity preceding it and is not included in the entity.</p>
	<p>
		All characters besides the white-space characters and delimiters are
		referred to as <em>regular characters</em>. These include nonprinting
		characters that are outside the recommended PostScript ASCII character
		set.
