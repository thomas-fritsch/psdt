	<h2>3.9 Named Resources</h2>
	<p>Some features of the PostScript language involve the use of
		open-ended collections of objects to control their operation. For
		example, the font machinery uses font dictionaries that describe the
		appearance of characters. The number of possible font dictionaries is
		unlimited. In LanguageLevels 2 and 3, this same idea applies to forms,
		patterns, color rendering dictionaries, and many other categories of
		objects.</p>
	<p>It is often convenient to associate these objects with names in
		some central registry. This is particularly true for fonts, which are
		assigned standard names (such as Times-Roman or Palatino-BoldItalic)
		when they are created. Other categories of objects also can benefit
		from a central naming convention.</p>
	<p>
		If all available objects in a particular category (for example, all
		possible fonts) were permanently resident in VM, they could simply be
		stored in some dictionary. Accessing a named object would be a matter
		of performing <a href="../8/2/g/get.html">get</a> from the dictionary;
		checking whether a named object is available would be accomplished by
		performing a <a href="../8/2/k/known.html">known</a> operation on the
		dictionary.
	</p>
	<p>There are many more fonts and objects of other categories than
		can possibly reside in VM at any given time. These objects originate
		from a source external to the PostScript interpreter. They are
		introduced into VM in two ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The application or print spooler embeds the objectsâ€™
			definitions directly in the job stream.</li>
		<li>During execution, the PostScript program requests the objects
			by name. The interpreter loads them into VM automatically from an
			external source, such as a disk file, a ROM cartridge, or a network
			file server.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The notion of <i>named resources (LanguageLevel 2)</i> supports the
		second method. A <i>resource</i> is a collection of named objects that
		either reside in VM or can be located and brought into VM on demand.
		There are separate categories of resources with independent name
		spaces; for example, fonts and forms are distinct resource categories.
		Within each category, there is a collection of named resource
		instances. Each category can have its own policy for locating
		instances that are not in VM and for managing the instances that are
		in VM.
