	<h2>3.12 Early Name Binding</h2>
	<p>Normally, when the PostScript language scanner encounters an
		executable name in the program being scanned, it simply produces an
		executable name object; it does not look up the value of the name. It
		looks up the name only when the name object is executed by the
		interpreter. The lookup occurs in the dictionaries that are on the
		dictionary stack at the time of execution.</p>
	<p>A name object contained in a procedure is looked up each time
		the procedure is executed. For example, given the definition</p>
	<pre>/average {add 2 div} def</pre>
	<p>
		the names <b>add</b> and <b>div</b> are looked up, yielding operators
		to be executed, every time the <b>average</b> procedure is invoked.
	</p>
	<p>
		This so-called late <i>binding</i> of names is an important feature of
		the PostScript language. However, there are situations in which <i>early
			binding</i> is advantageous. There are two facilities for looking up the
		values of names before execution: the bind operator and the <i>immediately
			evaluated name</i>.
