	<h2>3.1 Interpreter</h2>
	<p>The PostScript interpreter executes the PostScript language
		according to the rules in this chapter. These rules determine the
		order in which operations are carried out and how the pieces of a
		PostScript program fit together to produce the desired results.</p>
	<p>
		The interpreter manipulates entities called PostScript <em>objects</em>.
		Some objects are data, such as numbers, boolean values, strings, and
		arrays. Other objects are elements of programs to be executed, such as
		names, operators, and procedures. However, there is not a distinction
		between data and programs; any PostScript object may be treated as
		data or be executed as part of a program.
	</p>
	<p>
		The interpreter operates by executing a sequence of objects. The
		effect of executing a particular object depends on that objectâ€™s <em>type</em>,
		<em>attributes</em>, and <em>value</em>. For example, executing a
		number object causes the interpreter to push a copy of that object on
		the operand stack (to be described shortly). Executing a name object
		causes the interpreter to look up the name in a dictionary, fetch the
		associated value, and execute it. Executing an operator object causes
		the interpreter to perform a built-in action, such as adding two
		numbers or painting characters in raster memory.
	</p>
	<p>The objects to be executed by the interpreter come from two
		principal sources:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A character stream may be scanned according to the syntax
			rules of the Post- Script language, producing a sequence of new
			objects. As each object is scanned, it is immediately executed. The
			character stream may come from an external source, such as a file or
			a communication channel, or it may come from a string object
			previously stored in the PostScript interpreter's memory.</li>
		<li>Objects previously stored in an array in memory may be
			executed in sequence. Such an array is known as a <em>procedure</em>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The interpreter can switch back and forth between executing a
		procedure and scanning a character stream. For example, if the
		interpreter encounters a name in a character stream, it executes that
		name by looking it up in a dictionary and retrieving the associated
		value. If that value is a procedure object, the interpreter suspends
		scanning the character stream and begins executing the objects in the
		procedure. When it reaches the end of the procedure, it resumes
		scanning the character stream where it left off. The interpreter
		maintains an <em>execution stack</em> for remembering all of its
		suspended execution contexts.
