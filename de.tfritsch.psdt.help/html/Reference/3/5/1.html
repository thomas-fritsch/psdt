	<h3>3.5.1 Immediate Execution</h3>
	<p>Some example PostScript program fragments will help clarify the
		concept of execution. Example 3.1 illustrates the immediate execution
		of a few operators and operands to perform some simple arithmetic.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 3.1</b>
	</p>
	<pre>40 60 add 2 div</pre>
	<p>The interpreter first encounters the literal integer object 40
		and pushes it on the operand stack. Then it pushes the integer object
		60 on the operand stack.</p>
	<p>
		Next, it encounters the executable name object <a
			href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a>, which it looks up in the
		environment of the current dictionary stack. Unless <a
			href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a> has been redefined elsewhere, the
		interpreter finds it associated with an operator object, which it
		executes. This invokes a built-in function that pops the two integer
		objects off the operand stack, adds them together, and pushes the
		result (a new integer object whose value is 100) back on the operand
		stack.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rest of the program fragment is executed similarly. The
		interpreter pushes the integer 2 on the operand stack and then
		executes the name <a href="../../8/2/d/div.html">div</a>. The <a
			href="../../8/2/d/div.html">div</a> operator pops two operands off
		the stack (the integers whose values are 2 and 100), divides the
		second-to-top one by the top one (100 divided by 2, in this case), and
		pushes the real result 50.0 on the stack.
	</p>
	<p>The source of the objects being executed by the PostScript
		interpreter does not matter. They may have been contained within an
		array or scanned in from a character stream. Executing a sequence of
		objects produces the same result regardless of where the objects come
		from.</p>
