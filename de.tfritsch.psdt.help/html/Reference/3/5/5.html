	<h3>3.5.5 Execution of Specific Types</h3>
	<p>
		An object with the literal attribute is <i>always</i> treated as
		data&mdash;pushed on the operand stack by the
		interpreter&mdash;regardless of its type. Even operator objects are
		treated this way if they have the literal attribute.
	</p>
	<p>For many objects, executing them has the same effect as treating
		them as data. This is true of integer, real, boolean, dictionary,
		mark, save, gstate, and fontID objects. So the distinction between
		literal and executable objects of these types is meaningless. The
		following descriptions apply only to objects having the executable
		attribute.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An <i>executable array</i> or executable packed array
			(procedure) object is pushed on the operand stack if it is
			encountered directly by the interpreter. If it is invoked <i>indirectly</i>
			as a result of executing some other object (a name or an operator),
			it is called instead. The interpreter calls a procedure by pushing it
			on the execution stack and then executing the array elements in turn.
			When the interpreter reaches the end of the procedure, it pops the
			procedure object off the execution stack. (Actually, it pops the
			procedure object when there is one element remaining and then pushes
			that element; this permits unlimited depth of "tail recursion"
			without overflowing the execution stack.)
		</li>
		<li>An <i>executable string</i> object is pushed on the execution
			stack. The interpreter then uses the string as a source of characters
			to be converted to tokens and interpreted according to the PostScript
			syntax rules. This continues until the interpreter reaches the end of
			the string. Then it pops the string object from the execution stack.
		</li>
		<li>An <i>executable file</i> object is treated much the same as
			a string: The interpreter pushes it on the execution stack. It reads
			the characters of the file and interprets them as PostScript tokens
			until it encounters end-of-file. Then it closes the file and pops the
			file object from the execution stack. See Section <a href="../8.html">3.8,
				"File Input and Output."</a>
		</li>
		<li>An <i>executable name</i> object is looked up in the
			environment of the current dictionary stack and its associated value
			is executed. The interpreter looks first in the top dictionary on the
			dictionary stack and then in other dictionaries successively lower on
			the stack. If it finds the name as a key in some dictionary, it
			executes the associated value. To do that, it examines the value's
			type and executable attribute and performs the appropriate action
			described in this section. Note that if the value is a procedure, the
			interpreter executes it. If the interpreter fails to find the name in
			any dictionary on the dictionary stack, an <a
			href="../../8/2/u/undefined.html">undefined</a> error occurs.
		</li>
		<li>An <i>executable operator</i> object causes the interpreter
			to perform one of the builtin operations described in this book.
		<li>An <i>executable null</i> object causes the interpreter to
			perform no action. In particular, it does <i>not</i> push the object
			on the operand stack.
		</li>
	</ul>
