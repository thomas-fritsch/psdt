	<h3>3.5.3 Deferred Execution</h3>
	<p>The first line of Example 3.2 defines a procedure named average
		that computes the average of two numbers. The second line applies that
		procedure to the integers 40 and 60, producing the same result as
		Example 3.1.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 3.2</b>
	</p>
	<pre>/average {add 2 div} def
40 60 average</pre>
	<p>
		The interpreter first encounters the literal name average. Recall from
		Section <a href="../2.html">3.2, "Syntax,"</a> that / introduces a
		literal name. The interpreter pushes this object on the operand stack,
		as it would any object having the literal attribute.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, the interpreter encounters the executable array {add 2 div}.
		Recall that { and } enclose a <i>procedure</i> (an executable array or
		executable packed array object) that is produced by the scanner. This
		procedure contains three elements: the executable name <a
			href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a>, the literal integer 2, and the
		executable name div. The interpreter has not encountered these
		elements yet.
	</p>
	<p>Here is what the interpreter does:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Upon encountering this procedure object, the interpreter
			pushes it on the operand stack, even though the object has the
			executable attribute. This is explained shortly.</li>
		<li>The interpreter then encounters the executable name <a
			href="../../8/2/d/def.html">def</a>. Looking up this name in the
			current dictionary stack, it finds <a href="../../8/2/d/def.html">def</a>
			to be associated in <a href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>
			with an operator object, which it invokes.
		</li>
		<li>The <a href="../../8/2/d/def.html">def</a> operator pops two
			objects off the operand stack (the procedure {add 2 div} and the name
			average). It enters this pair into the current dictionary (most
			likely <a href="../../8/2/u/userdict.html">userdict</a>), creating a
			new association having the name average as its key and the procedure
			{add 2 div} as its value.
		</li>
		<li>The interpreter pushes the integer objects 40 and 60 on the
			operand stack, then encounters the executable name average.</li>
		<li>It looks up average in the current dictionary stack, finds it
			to be associated with the procedure {add 2 div}, and executes that
			procedure. In this case, execution of the array object consists of
			executing the elements of the array&mdash;the objects <a
			href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a>, 2, and <a
			href="../../8/2/d/div.html">div</a>&mdash;in sequence. This has the
			same effect as executing those objects directly. It produces the same
			result: the real object 50.0.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Why did the interpreter treat the procedure as data in the first line
		of the example but execute it in the second, despite the procedure
		having the executable attribute in both cases? There is a special rule
		that determines this behavior: An executable array or packed array
		encountered directly by the interpreter is treated as data (pushed on
		the operand stack), but an executable array or packed array
		encountered <i>indirectly</i>&mdash;as a result of executing some
		other object, such as a name or an operator&mdash;is invoked as a
		procedure.
	</p>
	<p>This rule reflects how procedures are ordinarily used.
		Procedures appearing directly (either as part of a program being read
		from a file or as part of some larger procedure in memory) are usually
		part of a definition or of a construct, such as a conditional, that
		operates on the procedure explicitly. But procedures obtained
		indirectly&mdash;for example, as a result of looking up a
		name&mdash;are usually intended to be executed. A PostScript program
		can override these semantics when necessary.</p>
