	<h3>3.5.2 Operand Order</h3>
	<p>
		In Example 3.1, 40 is the first and 60 is the second operand of the <a
			href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a> operator. That is, objects are
		referred to according to the order in which they are pushed on the
		operand stack. This is the reverse of the order in which they are
		popped off by the <a href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a> operator.
		Similarly, the result pushed by the <a href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a>
		operator is the first operand of the div operator, and 2 is its second
		operand.
	</p>
	<p>The same terminology applies to the results of an operator. If
		an operator pushes more than one object on the operand stack, the
		first object pushed is the first result. This order corresponds to the
		usual left-to-right order of appearance of operands in a PostScript
		program.</p>
