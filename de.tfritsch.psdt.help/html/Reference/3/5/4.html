	<h3>3.5.4 Control Constructs</h3>
	<p>In the PostScript language, control constructs such as
		conditionals and iterations are specified by means of operators that
		take procedures as operands. Example 3.3 computes the maximum of the
		values associated with the names a and b, as in the steps that follow.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 3.3</b>
	</p>
	<pre>a b gt {a} {b} ifelse</pre>
	<ol>
		<li>The interpreter encounters the executable names a and b in
			turn and looks them up. Assume both names are associated with
			numbers. Executing the numbers causes them to be pushed on the
			operand stack.</li>
		<li>The <a href="../*../8/2/g/gt.html">gt</a> (greater than)
			operator removes two operands from the stack and compares them. If
			the first operand is greater than the second, it pushes the boolean
			value <i>true</i>. Otherwise, it pushes <i>false</i>.
		</li>
		<li>The interpreter now encounters the procedure objects {a} and
			{b}, which it pushes on the operand stack.</li>
		<li>The <a href="../../8/2/i/ifelse.html">ifelse</a> operator
			takes three operands: a boolean object and two procedures. If the
			boolean object's value is <i>true</i>, <a
			href="../../8/2/i/ifelse.html">ifelse</a> causes the first procedure
			to be executed; otherwise, it causes the second procedure to be
			executed. All three operands are removed from the operand stack
			before the selected procedure is executed.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In this example, each procedure consists of a single element
		that is an executable name (either a or b). The interpreter looks up
		this name and, since it is associated with a number, pushes that
		number on the operand stack. So the result of executing the entire
		program fragment is to push on the operand stack the greater of the
		values associated with a and b.</p>
