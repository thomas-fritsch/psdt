	<h3>3.8.3 Special Files</h3>
	<p>The file operator can also return special files that are
		identified as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>%stdin, the standard input file.</li>
		<li>%stdout, the standard output file.</li>
		<li>%stderr, the standard error file. This file is for reporting
			low-level errors. In many configurations, it is the same as the
			standard output file.</li>
		<li>%statementedit, the statement editor filter file, described
			below.</li>
		<li>%lineedit, the line editor filter file, described below.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>For example, the statements</p>
	<pre>(%stdin) (r) file
(%stdout) (w) file</pre>
	<p>
		push copies of the standard input and output file objects on the
		operand stack. These are duplicates of existing file objects, not new
		objects. Each execution of the <a href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a>
		operator for %stdin, %stdout, or %stderr within a given job returns
		the same file object. A PostScript program should not close these
		files. In an interpreter that supports multiple execution contexts,
		the standard input and output files are private to each context; the
		standard error file is shared among all contexts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some PostScript interpreters support an interactive executive, invoked
		by the <a href="../../8/2/e/executive.html">executive</a> operator;
		this is described in Section <a href="../../2/4/4.html">2.4.4,
			"Using the Interpreter Interactively."</a> <a
			href="../../8/2/e/executive.html">executive</a> obtains commands from
		the user by means of a special file named %statementedit. Applying the
		<a href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a> operator to the file name
		string %statementedit causes the following to happen:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <a href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a> operator begins
			reading characters from the standard input file and storing them in a
			temporary buffer. While doing so, it echoes the characters to the
			standard output file. It also interprets certain control characters
			as editing functions for making corrections, as described in Section
			2.4.4.
		</li>
		<li>When a complete statement has been entered, the <a
			href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a> operator returns. A statement
			consists of one or more lines terminated by a newline that together
			form one or more complete PostScript tokens, with no opening brackets
			({, (, &lt;, or &lt;~) left unmatched. A statement is also considered
			complete if it contains a syntax error.
		</li>
		<li>The returned file object represents a temporary file
			containing the statement that was entered, including the terminating
			end-of-line character. Reading from this file obtains the characters
			of the statement in turn; end-of-file is reported when the end of the
			statement is reached. Normally, this file is used as an operand to
			the <a href="../../8/2/e/exec.html">exec</a> operator, causing the
			statement to be executed as a PostScript program.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The %lineedit special file is similar to %statementedit, except that
		when reading from %lineedit, the <a href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a>
		operator returns after a single line has been entered, whether or not
		it constitutes a complete statement. For both the special files
		%statementedit and %lineedit, if the standard input file reaches
		end-of-file before any characters have been entered, the <a
			href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a> operator issues an <a
			href="../../8/2/u/undefinedfilename.html">undefinedfilename</a>
		error.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is important to understand that the file object returned by <a
			href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a> for the %statementedit and
		%lineedit special files is not the same as the standard input file. It
		represents a temporary file containing a single buffered statement.
		When the end of that statement is reached, the file is closed and the
		file object is no longer of any use. Successive executions of <a
			href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a> for %statementedit and
		%lineedit return different file objects.
	</p>
	<p>The %statementedit and %lineedit special files are not available
		in PostScript interpreters that do not support an interactive
		executive. PostScript programs that are page descriptions should never
		refer to these files.</p>
