	<h4>Communication Channel Behavior</h4>
	<p>
		Communications functions often usurp control characters. Control codes
		are device-dependent and not part of the PostScript language. For
		example, the serial communication protocol supported by many products
		uses the Control-D character as an end-of-file indication. In this
		case, Control-D is a communications function and not logically part of
		a PostScript program. This applies specifically to the serial channel;
		other channels, such as LocalTalk<sup>TM</sup> and Ethernet, have
		different conventions for end-of-file and other control functions. <i>In
			all cases, communication channel behavior is independent of the
			actions of the PostScript interpreter.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two levels of PostScript EOL translation: one in the
		PostScript interpreter and one in the serial communication channel.
		The previous description applies <i>only</i> to the EOL conventions at
		the level of the PostScript interpreter. The purpose of the seemingly
		redundant communication-level EOL translation is to maintain
		compatibility with diverse host operating systems and communications
		environments.
	</p>
	<p>
		As discussed in Section <a href=../../2.html>3.2, "Syntax,"</a> the
		ASCII encoding of the language is designed for maximum portability. It
		avoids using control characters that might be preempted by operating
		systems or communication channels. However, there are situations in
		which transmission of arbitrary binary data is desirable. For example,
		sampled images are represented by large quantities of binary data. The
		PostScript language has an alternative binary encoding that is
		advantageous in certain situations. There are two main ways to deal
		with PostScript programs that contain binary information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Communicate with the interpreter via binary channels
			exclusively. Some channels, such as LocalTalk and Ethernet, are
			binary by nature. They do not preempt any character codes, but
			instead communicate control information separately from the data.
			Other channels, such as serial channels, may support a binary
			communication protocol that allows control characters to be quoted.
			This approach presupposes a well-controlled environment. PostScript
			programs produced in that environment may not be portable to other
			environments.</li>
		<li>Take advantage of filters for encoding binary data as ASCII
			text. Filters are a LanguageLevel 2 feature, described in Section <a
			href="../4.html">3.8.4, "Filters."</a> Programs represented in this
			way do not include any control codes and are therefore portable to
			any LanguageLevel 2 or 3 interpreter in any environment.
		</li>
	</ul>
