	<h4>Standard Input and Output Files</h4>
	<p>
		All PostScript interpreters provide a <i>standard input file</i> and a
		<i>standard output file</i>, which usually represent a real-time
		communication channel to and from another computer. The standard input
		and output files are always present; it is not necessary for a program
		to create or close them.
	</p>
	<p>
		The PostScript interpreter reads and interprets the standard input
		file as PostScript program text. It sends error and status messages to
		the standard output file. Also, a PostScript program may execute the <a
			href="../../../8/2/p/print.html">print</a> operator to send arbitrary
		data to the standard output file. Note that <a
			href="../../../8/2/p/print.html">print</a> is a <i>file</i> operator;
		it has nothing to do with placing text on a page or causing pages to
		emerge from a printer.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is seldom necessary for a PostScript program to deal explicitly
		with file objects for the standard files, because the PostScript
		interpreter reads the standard input file by default and the print
		operator references the standard output file implicitly. Additionally,
		the file currently being read by the PostScript interpreter is
		available via the <a href="../../../8/2/c/currentfile.html">currentfile</a>
		operator; this file need not be the standard input file. However, when
		necessary, a program may apply the <a href="../../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a>
		operator to the identifying strings %stdin or %stdout to obtain file
		objects for the standard input and output files; see Section <a
			href="../3.html">3.8.3, "Special Files."</a>
