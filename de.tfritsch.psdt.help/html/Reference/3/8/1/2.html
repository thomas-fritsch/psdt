	<h4>End-of-Line Conventions</h4>
	<p>
		The PostScript language scanner and the <a
			href="../../../8/2/r/readline.html">readline</a> operator recognize
		all three external forms of end-of-line (EOL)&mdash;CR alone, LF
		alone, and the CR-LF pair&mdash; and treat them uniformly, translating
		them as described below. The PostScript interpreter does not perform
		any such translation when reading data by other means or when writing
		data by any means.
	</p>
	<p>End-of-line sequences are recognized and treated specially in
		the following situations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Any of the three forms of EOL appearing in a literal string
			is converted to a single LF character in the resulting string object.
			These three examples produce identical string objects, each with an
			LF character following the second word in the string:<pre>
(any text<sup>&lt;CR&gt;</sup>some more text)
(any text<sup>&lt;LF&gt;</sup>some more text)
(any text<sup>&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;</sup>some more text)</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Any of the three forms of EOL appearing immediately after \
			in a string is treated as a line continuation; both the \ and the EOL
			are discarded. These four examples produce identical string objects:<pre>
(any text \<sup>&lt;CR&gt;</sup>some more text)
(any text \<sup>&lt;LF&gt;</sup>some more text)
(any text \<sup>&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;</sup>some more text)
(any text some more text)</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Any of the three forms of EOL appearing outside a string is
			treated as a single white-space character. Since the language treats
			multiple white-space characters as a single white-space character,
			the treatment of EOL is interesting only when a PostScript token is
			followed by data to be read explicitly by one of the file operators.
			The following three examples produce identical results: the operator
			reads the character x from the current input file and leaves its
			character code (the integer 120) on the stack. <pre>
currentfile read<sup>&lt;CR&gt;</sup>x
currentfile read<sup>&lt;LF&gt;</sup>
currentfile read<sup>&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;</sup>x</pre>
		</li>
		<li>The <a href="../../../8/2/r/readline.html">readline</a>
			operator treats any of the three forms of EOL as the termination
			condition.
		</li>
		<li>Data read by <a href="../../../8/2/r/read.html">read</a> and
			<a href="../../../8/2/r/readstring.html">readstring</a> does not
			undergo EOL translation: the PostScript interpreter reads whatever
			characters were received from the channel. The same is true of data
			written by <a href="../../../8/2/w/write.html">write</a> and <a
			href="../../../8/2/w/writestring.html">writestring</a>: whatever
			characters the interpreter provides are sent to the channel. However,
			in either case the channel itself may perform some EOL translation,
			as discussed below.
		</li>
	</ul>
