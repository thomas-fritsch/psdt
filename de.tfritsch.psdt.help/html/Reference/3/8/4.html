	<h3>3.8.4 Filters</h3>
	<p>
		A <i>filter (LanguageLevel 2)</i> is a special kind of file object
		that can be layered on top of some other file to transform data being
		read from or written to that file. When a PostScript program reads
		characters from an input filter, the filter reads characters from its
		underlying file and transforms the data in some way, depending on the
		filter. Similarly, when a program writes characters to an output
		filter, the filter transforms the data and writes the results to its
		underlying file.
	</p>
	<p>
		An <i>encoding filter</i> is an output file that takes the data
		written to it, converts it to some encoded representation depending on
		the filter, and writes the encoded data to the underlying file. For
		example, the <b>ASCIIHexEncode</b> filter transforms binary data to an
		ASCII hexadecimal-encoded representation, which it writes to its
		underlying file. All encoding filters have <b>Encode</b> as part of
		their names.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <i>decoding filter</i> is an input file that reads encoded data from
		its underlying file and decodes it. The program reading from the
		filter receives the decoded data. For example, the <b>ASCIIHexDecode</b>
		filter reads ASCII hexadecimal-encoded data from its underlying file
		and transforms it to binary. All decoding filters have <b>Decode</b>
		as part of their names.
	</p>
	<p>Decoding filters are most likely to be used in page
		descriptions. An application program generating a page description can
		encode certain information (for example, data for sampled images) to
		compress it or to convert it to a portable ASCII representation. Then,
		within the page description itself, it invokes the corresponding
		decoding filter to convert the information back to its original form.</p>
	<p>Encoding filters are unlikely to be used in most page
		descriptions. However, a PostScript program can use them to encode
		data to be sent back to the application or written to a disk file. In
		the interest of symmetry, the PostScript language defines both
		encoding and decoding filters for all of its standard data
		transformation algorithms. However, encoding filters are optional; not
		all PostScript interpreters support them.</p>
