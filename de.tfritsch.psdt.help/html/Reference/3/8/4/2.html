	<h4>Standard Filters</h4>
	<p>The PostScript language supports a standard set of filters that
		fall into three main categories:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>ASCII encoding and decoding filters</i> enable arbitrary
			8-bit binary data to be represented in the printable subset of the
			ASCII character set. This improves the portability of the resulting
			data, since it avoids the problem of interference by operating
			systems or communication channels that preempt the use of control
			characters, represent text as 7-bit bytes, or impose line-length
			restrictions.</li>
		<li><i>Compression and decompression filters</i> enable data to
			be represented in a compressed form. Compression is particularly
			valuable for large sampled images, since it reduces storage
			requirements and transmission time. There are several compression
			filters, each of which is best suited for particular kinds of data.
			Note that the compressed data is in 8-bit binary format, even if the
			original data happens to be ASCII text. For maximum portability of
			the encoded data, these filters should be used with ASCII encoding
			filters, as illustrated above in Example 3.5.</li>
		<li><i>Subfile filters</i> pass data through without
			modification. These filters permit the creation of file objects that
			access arbitrary user-defined data sources or data targets. Input
			filters also can read data from an underlying file up to a specified
			end-of-data marker.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Table 3.6 summarizes the available filters. A program can determine
		the complete set of filters that the PostScript interpreter supports
		by applying the resourceforall operator to the Filter resource
		category; see Section <a href="../../9.html">3.9, "Named
			Resources."</a>
	</p>

			<th><a href="../../13/3/1.html#2">ASCIIHexEncode</a></th>
			<td>(none)</td>
			<td>Encodes binary data in an ASCII hexadecimal representation.
				Each binary data byte is converted to two hexadecimal digits,
				resulting in an expansion factor of 1:2 in the size of the encoded

			<td>(none)</td>
			<td>Encodes binary data in an ASCII base-85 representation. This
				encoding uses nearly all of the printable ASCII character set. The
				resulting expansion factor is 4:5, making this encoding much more
				efficient than hexadecimal.</td>
