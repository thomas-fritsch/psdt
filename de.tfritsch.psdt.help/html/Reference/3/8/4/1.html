	<h4>Creating Filters</h4>
	<p>
		Filter files are created by the <a href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a>
		operator <i>(LanguageLevel 2)</i>. The <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a> operator expects the
		following operands in the order given:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A <i>data source</i> or <i>data target</i>. This is
			ordinarily a file object that represents the underlying file the
			filter is to read or write. However, it can also be a string or a
			procedure. Details are provided in Section <a href="../../13/1.html">3.13.1,
				"Data Sources and Targets."</a>
		</li>
		<li><i>Filter parameters.</i> All filters may take additional
			parameters, and some require additional parameters, to control how
			they operate. These parameters may be specified in a dictionary given
			as an operand following the data source or target; in some cases,
			required parameters must be given as operands following the data
			source or target or following the dictionary operand, if any. The
			dictionary operand may be omitted whenever all the
			dictionary-supplied parameters have the corresponding default values
			for that filter. Exactly which parameters and operands are required
			for the various filters is described in Section <a
			href="../../13.html">3.13, "Filtered Files Details."</a></li>
		<li><i>Filter name.</i> This is a name object, such as <b>ASCIIHexDecode</b>,
			that specifies the data transformation the filter is to perform. It
			also determines how many parameters there are and how they are to be
			interpreted.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a> operator returns a
		new file object that represents the filtered file. For an encoding
		filter, this is an output file, and for a decoding filter, an input
		file. The direction of the underlying file&mdash;that is, its
		read/write attribute&mdash;must match that of the filter. Filtered
		files can be used just the same as other files; they are valid as
		operands to file operators such as <a href="../../../8/2/r/read.html">read</a>,
		<a href="../../../8/2/w/write.html">write</a>, <a
			href="../../../8/2/r/readstring.html">readstring</a>, and <a
			href="../../../8/2/w/writestring.html">writestring</a>. Input filters
		are also valid as data sources for operators such as <a
			href="../../../8/2/e/exec.html">exec</a> or <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since a filter is itself a file, it can be used as the underlying file
		for yet another filter. Filters can be cascaded to form a <i>pipeline</i>
		that passes the data stream through two or more encoding or decoding
		transformations in sequence. Example 3.5 illustrates the construction
		of an input pipeline for decoding sampled image data that is embedded
		in the program. The application has encoded the image data twice: once
		using the <b>RunLengthEncode</b> method to compress the data, and then
		using the <b>ASCII85Encode</b> method to represent the binary
		compressed data as ASCII text.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 5.5</b>
	</p>
	<pre>256 256 8 [256 0 0 -256 0 256]   % Other operands of the image operator
currentfile
/ASCII85Decode filter
/RunLengthDecode filter
image
<i>... Encoded image data ...</i>
~>                               % ASCII85 end-of-data marker</pre>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../../8/2/c/currentfile.html">currentfile</a> operator
		returns the file object from which the PostScript interpreter is
		currently executing. The first execution of <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a> creates an <b>ASCII85Decode</b>
		filter whose underlying file is the one returned by <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/currentfile.html">currentfile</a>. It pushes the
		filter file object on the stack. The second execution of <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a> creates a <b>RunLengthDecode</b>
		filter whose underlying file is the first filter file; it pushes the
		new filter file object on the stack. Finally, the <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator uses the second
		filter file as its data source. As <a href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a>
		reads from its data source, the data is drawn from the underlying file
		and transformed by the two filters in sequence.
