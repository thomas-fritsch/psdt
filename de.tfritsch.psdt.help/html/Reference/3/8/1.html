	<h3>3.8.1 Basic File Operators</h3>
	<p>
		A PostScript <i>file object</i> represents a file. The file operators
		take a file object as an operand to read or write characters. Ignoring
		for the moment <i>how</i> a file object comes into existence, the file
		operators include the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/r/read.html">read</a> reads the next
			character from an input file.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/w/write.html">write</a> appends a
			character to an output file.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/r/readstring.html">readstring</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/readline.html">readline</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/w/writestring.html">writestring</a> transfer the
			contents of strings to and from files.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/r/readhexstring.html">readhexstring</a>
			and <a href="../../8/2/w/writehexstring.html">writehexstring</a> read
			and write binary data represented in the file by hexadecimal
			notation.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/t/token.html">token</a> scans characters
			from an input file according to the PostScript language syntax rules.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/e/exec.html">exec</a>, applied to an input
			file, causes the PostScript interpreter to execute a PostScript
			program from that file.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The operators that write to a file do not necessarily deliver the
		characters to their destination immediately. They may leave some
		characters in buffers for reasons of implementation or efficiency. The
		<a href="../../8/2/f/flush.html">flush</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/f/flushfile.html">flushfile</a> operators deliver
		these buffered characters immediately. These operators are useful in
		certain situations, such as during two-way interactions with another
		computer or with a human user, when such data must be transmitted
		immediately.
