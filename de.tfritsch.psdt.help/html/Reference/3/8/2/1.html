	<h4>Creating and Closing a File Object</h4>
	<p>
		File objects are created by the <a href="../../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a>
		operator. This operator takes two strings: the first identifies the
		file and the second specifies access. <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a> returns a new file object
		associated with that file.
	</p>
	<p>
		An <i>access string</i> is a string object that specifies how a file
		is to be accessed. File access conventions are similar to the ones
		defined by the ANSI C standard, although some file systems may not
		support all access methods. The access string always begins with r, w,
		or a, possibly followed by +; any additional characters supply
		operating systemâ€“specific information. Table 3.5 lists access strings
		and their meanings.
	</p>
	<table>
		<caption>TABLE 3.5 Access strings</caption>
		<tr>
			<th>Access string</th>
			<th>Meaning</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>r</td>
			<td>Open for reading only. Generate an error if the file does
				not already exist.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>w</td>
			<td>Open for writing only. Create the file if it does not
				already exist. Truncate and overwrite it if it does exist.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>a</td>
			<td>Open for writing only. Create the file if it does not
				already exist. Append to it if it does exist.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>r+</td>
			<td>Open for reading and writing. Generate an error if the file
				does not already exist.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>w+</td>
			<td>Open for reading and writing. Create the file if it does not
				already exist. Truncate and overwrite it if it does exist.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>a+</td>
			<td>Open for reading and writing. Create the file if it does not
				already exist. Append to it if it does exist.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The special files %stdin, %lineedit, and
			%statementedit allow only r access; %stdout and %stderr allow only w
			access (see Section <a href="../3.html">3.8.3, "Special Files"</a>).</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Like other composite objects, such as strings and arrays, file objects
		have access attributes. The access attribute of a file object is based
		on the access string used to create it. Attempting to access a file
		object in a way that would violate its access attribute causes an <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a> error.
	</p>
	<p>
		Certain files&mdash;in particular, named files on disk&mdash;are <i>positionable</i>,
		meaning that the data in the file can be accessed in an arbitrary
		order rather than only sequentially from the beginning. The <a
			href="../../../8/2/s/setfileposition.html">setfileposition</a>
		operator adjusts a file object so that it refers to a specified
		position in the underlying file; subsequent reads or writes access the
		file at that new position. Specifying a plus sign (+) in the access
		string opens a positionable file for reading and writing, as shown in
		Table 3.5. To ensure predictable results, it is necessary to execute <a
			href="../../../8/2/s/setfileposition.html">setfileposition</a> when
		switching between reading and writing.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the end of reading or writing a file, a program should <i>close</i>
		the file to break the association between the PostScript file object
		and the actual file. The file operators close a file automatically if
		end-of-file is encountered during reading (see below). The <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/closefile.html">closefile</a> operator closes a
		file explicitly. <a href="../../../8/2/r/restore.html">restore</a>
		closes a file if the file object was created since the corresponding <a
			href="../../../8/2/s/save.html">save</a> operation while in local VM
		allocation mode. Garbage collection closes a file if the file object
		is no longer accessible.
	</p>
	<p>
		All operators that access files treat end-of-file and exception
		conditions the same. During reading, if an end-of-file indication is
		encountered before the requested item can be read, the file is closed
		and the operation returns an explicit end-offile result. This also
		occurs if the file has already been closed when the operator is
		executed. All other exceptions during reading and any exceptions
		during writing result in execution of the error <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/ioerror.html">ioerror</a>, <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/invalidfileaccess.html">invalidfileaccess</a>,
		or <a href="../../../8/2/i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a>.
