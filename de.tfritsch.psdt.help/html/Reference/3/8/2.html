	<h3>3.8.2 Named Files</h3>
	<p>The PostScript language provides access to named files in
		secondary storage. The file access capabilities are part of the
		integration of the language with an underlying operating system; there
		are variations from one such integration to another. Not all the file
		system capabilities of the underlying operating system are necessarily
		made available at the PostScript language level.</p>
	<p>
		The PostScript language provides a standard set of operators for
		accessing named files. These operators are supported in LanguageLevels
		2 and 3, as well as in certain LanguageLevel 1 implementations that
		have access to file systems. The operators are <a
			href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/d/deletefile.html">deletefile</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/renamefile.html">renamefile</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/status.html">status</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/f/filenameforall.html">filenameforall</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setfileposition.html">setfileposition</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/f/fileposition.html">fileposition</a>. Even in
		LanguageLevel 1 implementations that do not support named files, the
		file operator is supported, because the special file names %stdin,
		%stdout, and %stderr are always allowed (see Section <a href="3.html">3.8.3,
			"Special Files"</a>). Although the language defines a standard framework
		for dealing with files, the detailed semantics of the file system
		operators, particularly file naming conventions, are operating
		system-dependent.
	</p>
	<p>Files are stored in one or more "secondary storage devices,"
		hereafter referred to simply as devices. (These are not to be confused
		with the "current device," which is a raster output device identified
		in the graphics state.) The PostScript language defines a uniform
		convention for naming devices, but it says nothing about how files in
		a given device are named. Different devices have different properties,
		and not all devices support all operations.</p>
	<p>
		A complete file name has the form <i>%device%file</i>, where device
		identifies the secondary storage device and file is the name of the
		file within the device. When a complete file name is presented to a
		file system operator, the device portion selects the device; the file
		portion is in turn presented to the implementation of that device,
		which is operating system-dependent and environment-dependent.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Typically, file names cannot contain null
			characters (ASCII code 0); if a file name is specified by a string
			object containing a null character, the null character will
			effectively terminate the file name.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		When a file name is presented without a <i>%device%</i> prefix, a
		search rule determines which device is selected. The available storage
		devices are consulted in order; the requested operation is attempted
		on each device until the operation succeeds. The number of available
		devices, their names, and the order in which they are searched is
		environment-dependent. Not all devices necessarily participate in such
		searches; some devices can be accessed only by explicitly naming them.
	</p>
	<p>
		In an interpreter that runs on top of an operating system, there may
		be a device that represents the complete file system provided by the
		operating system. If so, by convention that device's name is os; thus,
		complete file names are in the form %os%file, where <i>file</i>
		conforms to underlying file system conventions. This device always
		participates in searches, as described above; a program can access
		ordinary files without specifying the %os% prefix. There may be more
		than one device that behaves in this way; the names of such devices
		are product-dependent.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The os device may impose some restrictions on the
			set of files that can be accessed. Restrictions are necessary when
			the PostScript interpreter executes with a user identity different
			from that of the user running the application program.</i>
	</p>
	<p>In an interpreter that controls a dedicated product, such as a
		typical printer product, there can be one or more devices that
		represent file systems on disks and cartridges. Files on these devices
		have names such as %disk0%file, %disk1%file, and %cartridge0%file.
		Again, these devices participate in searches when the device name is
		not specified.</p>
	<p>
		Each of the operators <a href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/d/deletefile.html">deletefile</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/renamefile.html">renamefile</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/status.html">status</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/f/filenameforall.html">filenameforall</a> takes a <i>filename</i>
		operand&mdash;a string object that identifies a file. The name of the
		file can be in one of three forms:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>%device%file</i> identifies a named file on a specific
			device, as described above.</li>
		<li><i>file</i> (first character not %) identifies a named file
			on an unspecified device, which is selected by an
			environment-specific search rule, as described above.</li>
		<li><i>%device</i> or <i>%device%</i> identifies an unnamed file
			on the device. Certain devices, such as cartridges, support a single
			unnamed file as opposed to a collection of named files. Other devices
			represent communication channels rather than permanent storage media.
			There are also special files named %stdin, %stdout, %stderr,
			%statementedit, and %lineedit, described in Section <a href="3.html">3.8.3,
				"Special Files."</a> The <a href="../../8/2/d/deletefile.html">deletefile</a>,
			<a href="../../8/2/r/renamefile.html">renamefile</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/f/filenameforall.html">filenameforall</a> operators
			do not apply to file names of this form.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		"Wildcard" file names are recognized by the <a
			href="../../8/2/f/filenameforall.html">filenameforall</a> operator;
		see <a href="../../8/2/f/filenameforall.html">filenameforall</a> in
		Chapter 8 for more information.
