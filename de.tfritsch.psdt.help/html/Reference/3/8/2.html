	<h3>3.8.2 Named Files</h3>
	<p>The PostScript language provides access to named files in
		secondary storage. The file access capabilities are part of the
		integration of the language with an underlying operating system; there
		are variations from one such integration to another. Not all the file
		system capabilities of the underlying operating system are necessarily
		made available at the PostScript language level.</p>
	<p>
		The PostScript language provides a standard set of operators for
		accessing named files. These operators are supported in LanguageLevels
		2 and 3, as well as in certain LanguageLevel 1 implementations that
		have access to file systems. The operators are <a
			href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/d/deletefile.html">deletefile</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/renamefile.html">renamefile</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/status.html">status</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/f/filenameforall.html">filenameforall</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setfileposition.html">setfileposition</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/f/fileposition.html">fileposition</a>. Even in
		LanguageLevel 1 implementations that do not support named files, the
		file operator is supported, because the special file names %stdin,
		%stdout, and %stderr are always allowed (see Section <a href="3.html">3.8.3,
			"Special Files"</a>). Although the language defines a standard framework
		for dealing with files, the detailed semantics of the file system
		operators, particularly file naming conventions, are operating
		system-dependent.
	</p>
	<p>Files are stored in one or more "secondary storage devices,"
		hereafter referred to simply as devices. (These are not to be confused
		with the "current device," which is a raster output device identified
		in the graphics state.) The PostScript language defines a uniform
		convention for naming devices, but it says nothing about how files in
		a given device are named. Different devices have different properties,
		and not all devices support all operations.</p>
	<p>
		A complete file name has the form <i>%device%file</i>, where device
		identifies the secondary storage device and file is the name of the
		file within the device. When a complete file name is presented to a
		file system operator, the device portion selects the device; the file
		portion is in turn presented to the implementation of that device,
		which is operating system-dependent and environment-dependent.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Typically, file names cannot contain null
			characters (ASCII code 0); if a file name is specified by a string
			object containing a null character, the null character will
			effectively terminate the file name.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		When a file name is presented without a <i>%device%</i> prefix, a
		search rule determines which device is selected. The available storage
		devices are consulted in order; the requested operation is attempted
		on each device until the operation succeeds. The number of available
		devices, their names, and the order in which they are searched is
		environment-dependent. Not all devices necessarily participate in such
		searches; some devices can be accessed only by explicitly naming them.
	</p>
	<p>
		In an interpreter that runs on top of an operating system, there may
		be a device that represents the complete file system provided by the
		operating system. If so, by convention that device's name is os; thus,
		complete file names are in the form %os%file, where <i>file</i>
		conforms to underlying file system conventions. This device always
		participates in searches, as described above; a program can access
		ordinary files without specifying the %os% prefix. There may be more
		than one device that behaves in this way; the names of such devices
		are product-dependent.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The os device may impose some restrictions on the
			set of files that can be accessed. Restrictions are necessary when
			the PostScript interpreter executes with a user identity different
			from that of the user running the application program.</i>
	</p>
	<p>In an interpreter that controls a dedicated product, such as a
		typical printer product, there can be one or more devices that
		represent file systems on disks and cartridges. Files on these devices
		have names such as %disk0%file, %disk1%file, and %cartridge0%file.
		Again, these devices participate in searches when the device name is
		not specified.</p>
	<p>
		Each of the operators <a href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/d/deletefile.html">deletefile</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/renamefile.html">renamefile</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/status.html">status</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/f/filenameforall.html">filenameforall</a> takes a <i>filename</i>
		operand&mdash;a string object that identifies a file. The name of the
		file can be in one of three forms:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>%device%file</i> identifies a named file on a specific
			device, as described above.</li>
		<li><i>file</i> (first character not %) identifies a named file
			on an unspecified device, which is selected by an
			environment-specific search rule, as described above.</li>
		<li><i>%device</i> or <i>%device%</i> identifies an unnamed file
			on the device. Certain devices, such as cartridges, support a single
			unnamed file as opposed to a collection of named files. Other devices
			represent communication channels rather than permanent storage media.
			There are also special files named %stdin, %stdout, %stderr,
			%statementedit, and %lineedit, described in Section <a href="3.html">3.8.3,
				"Special Files."</a> The <a href="../../8/2/d/deletefile.html">deletefile</a>,
			<a href="../../8/2/r/renamefile.html">renamefile</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/f/filenameforall.html">filenameforall</a> operators
			do not apply to file names of this form.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		"Wildcard" file names are recognized by the <a
			href="../../8/2/f/filenameforall.html">filenameforall</a> operator;
		see <a href="../../8/2/f/filenameforall.html">filenameforall</a> in
		Chapter 8 for more information.
	</p>
	<h4 id="1">Creating and Closing a File Object</h4>
	<p>
		File objects are created by the <a href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a>
		operator. This operator takes two strings: the first identifies the
		file and the second specifies access. <a href="../../8/2/f/file.html">file</a>
		returns a new file object associated with that file.
	</p>
	<p>
		An <i>access string</i> is a string object that specifies how a file
		is to be accessed. File access conventions are similar to the ones
		defined by the ANSI C standard, although some file systems may not
		support all access methods. The access string always begins with r, w,
		or a, possibly followed by +; any additional characters supply
		operating system–specific information. Table 3.5 lists access strings
		and their meanings.
	</p>
	<table>
		<caption>TABLE 3.5 Access strings</caption>
		<tr>
			<th>Access string</th>
			<th>Meaning</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>r</td>
			<td>Open for reading only. Generate an error if the file does
				not already exist.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>w</td>
			<td>Open for writing only. Create the file if it does not
				already exist. Truncate and overwrite it if it does exist.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>a</td>
			<td>Open for writing only. Create the file if it does not
				already exist. Append to it if it does exist.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>r+</td>
			<td>Open for reading and writing. Generate an error if the file
				does not already exist.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>w+</td>
			<td>Open for reading and writing. Create the file if it does not
				already exist. Truncate and overwrite it if it does exist.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>a+</td>
			<td>Open for reading and writing. Create the file if it does not
				already exist. Append to it if it does exist.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The special files %stdin, %lineedit, and
			%statementedit allow only r access; %stdout and %stderr allow only w
			access (see Section <a href="3.html">3.8.3, "Special Files"</a>).</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Like other composite objects, such as strings and arrays, file objects
		have access attributes. The access attribute of a file object is based
		on the access string used to create it. Attempting to access a file
		object in a way that would violate its access attribute causes an <a
			href="../../8/2/i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a> error.
	</p>
	<p>
		Certain files&mdash;in particular, named files on disk—are <i>positionable</i>,
		meaning that the data in the file can be accessed in an arbitrary
		order rather than only sequentially from the beginning. The <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setfileposition.html">setfileposition</a> operator
		adjusts a file object so that it refers to a specified position in the
		underlying file; subsequent reads or writes access the file at that
		new position. Specifying a plus sign (+) in the access string opens a
		positionable file for reading and writing, as shown in Table 3.5. To
		ensure predictable results, it is necessary to execute <a
			href="../../8/2/s/setfileposition.html">setfileposition</a> when
		switching between reading and writing.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the end of reading or writing a file, a program should <i>close</i>
		the file to break the association between the PostScript file object
		and the actual file. The file operators close a file automatically if
		end-of-file is encountered during reading (see below). The <a
			href="../../8/2/c/closefile.html">closefile</a> operator closes a
		file explicitly. <a href="../../8/2/r/restore.html">restore</a> closes
		a file if the file object was created since the corresponding <a
			href="../../8/2/s/save.html">save</a> operation while in local VM
		allocation mode. Garbage collection closes a file if the file object
		is no longer accessible.
	</p>
	<p>
		All operators that access files treat end-of-file and exception
		conditions the same. During reading, if an end-of-file indication is
		encountered before the requested item can be read, the file is closed
		and the operation returns an explicit end-offile result. This also
		occurs if the file has already been closed when the operator is
		executed. All other exceptions during reading and any exceptions
		during writing result in execution of the error <a
			href="../../8/2/i/ioerror.html">ioerror</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/i/invalidfileaccess.html">invalidfileaccess</a>, or <a
			href="../../8/2/i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a>.
