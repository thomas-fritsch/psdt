	<h3>3.3.9 Dictionary Objects</h3>
	<p>
		A <i>dictionary</i> is an associative table whose entries are pairs of
		PostScript objects. The first element of an entry is the <i>key</i>
		and the second element is the <i>value</i>. The PostScript language
		includes operators that insert an entry into a dictionary, look up a
		key and fetch the associated value, and perform various other
		operations.
	</p>
	<p>
		Keys are normally name objects. The PostScript syntax and the
		interpreter are optimized for this most common case. However, a key
		may be any PostScript object except <a href="../../8/2/n/null.html">null</a>
		(defined later). If you attempt to use a string as a key, the
		PostScript interpreter will first convert the string to a name object;
		thus, <i>strings and names are interchangeable when used as keys
			in dictionaries</i>. Consequently, a string used as a dictionary key is
		subject to the implementation limit on the length of a name.
	</p>
	<p>
		A dictionary has the capacity to hold a certain maximum number of
		entries; the capacity is specified when the dictionary is created.
		PostScript interpreters of different LanguageLevels differ in their
		behavior when a program attempts to insert an entry into a dictionary
		that is full: in LanguageLevel 1, a <a
			href="../../8/2/d/dictfull.html">dictfull</a> error occurs; in
		LanguageLevels 2 and 3, the interpreter enlarges the dictionary
		automatically. The length of a dictionary is also subject to an
		implementation limit; see Appendix B.
	</p>
	<p>Dictionaries ordinarily associate the names and values of a
		program's components, such as variables and procedures. This
		association corresponds to the conventional use of identifiers in
		other programming languages. But there are many other uses for
		dictionaries. For example, a PostScript font program contains a
		dictionary that associates the names of characters with the procedures
		for drawing those characters' shapes (see Chapter 5).</p>
	<p>There are three primary methods for accessing dictionaries:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Operators exist to access a specific dictionary supplied as
			an operand.</li>
		<li>There is a <i>current dictionary</i> and a set of operators
			to access it implicitly.
		</li>
		<li>The interpreter automatically looks up executable names it
			encounters in the program being executed.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The interpreter maintains a <i>dictionary stack</i> defining the
		current dynamic name space. Dictionaries may be pushed on and popped
		off the dictionary stack at will. The topmost dictionary on the stack
		is the <i>current dictionary</i>.
	</p>
	<p>When the interpreter looks up a key implicitly&mdash;for
		example, when it executes a name object&mdash;it searches for the key
		in the dictionaries on the dictionary stack. It searches first in the
		topmost dictionary, then in successively lower dictionaries on the
		dictionary stack, until it either finds the key or exhausts the
		dictionary stack.</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 1, there are two built-in dictionaries permanently on
		the dictionary stack; they are called <a
			href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/u/userdict.html">userdict</a>. In LanguageLevels 2
		and 3, there are three dictionaries: <a
			href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/g/globaldict.html">globaldict</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/u/userdict.html">userdict</a>.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> is a
			read-only dictionary that associates the names of all the Post-
			Script operators (those defined in this book) with their values (the
			built-in actions that implement them). It also contains other
			definitions, including the standard local and global dictionaries
			listed in Section <a href="../7/5.html">3.7.5, "Standard and
				User-Defined Dictionaries,"</a> as well as various named constants such
			as <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/g/globaldict.html">globaldict</a> <i>(LanguageLevel
				2)</i> is a writeable dictionary in <i>global VM</i>. This is explained
			in Section <a href="../7/2.html">3.7.2, "Local and Global VM."</a></li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/u/userdict.html">userdict</a> is a
			writeable dictionary in <i>local VM</i>. It is the default modifiable
			naming environment normally used by PostScript programs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<a href="../../8/2/u/userdict.html">userdict</a> is the topmost of the
		permanent dictionaries on the dictionary stack. The <a
			href="../../8/2/d/def.html">def</a> operator puts definitions there
		unless the program has pushed some other dictionary on the dictionary
		stack. Applications can and should create their own dictionaries
		rather than put things in <a href="../../8/2/u/userdict.html">userdict</a>.
	</p>
	<p>A dictionary is a composite object. Copying a dictionary object
		does not copy the dictionary's contents. Instead, the contents are
		shared.</p>
