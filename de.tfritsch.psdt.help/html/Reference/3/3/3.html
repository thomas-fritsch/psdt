	<h3>3.3.3 Integer and Real Objects</h3>
	<p>
		The PostScript language provides two types of numeric object: <i>integer</i>
		and <i>real</i>. Integer objects represent mathematical integers
		within a certain interval centered at 0. Real objects approximate
		mathematical real numbers within a much larger interval, but with
		limited precision; they are implemented as floating-point numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most PostScript arithmetic and mathematical operators can be applied
		to numbers of both types. The interpreter performs automatic type
		conversion when necessary. Some operators expect only integers or a
		subrange of the integers as operands. There are operators to convert
		from one data type to another explicitly. Throughout this book, <i>number</i>
		means an object whose type is either integer or real.
	</p>
	<p>The range and precision of numbers is limited by the internal
		representations used in the machine on which the PostScript
		interpreter is running. Appendix B gives these limits for typical
		implementations of the PostScript interpreter.</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The machine representation of integers is
			accessible to a PostScript program through the bitwise operators.
			However, the representation of integers may depend on the CPU
			architecture of the implementation. The machine representation of
			real numbers is not accessible to PostScript programs.</i>
