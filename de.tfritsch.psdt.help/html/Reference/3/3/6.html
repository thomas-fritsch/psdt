	<h3>3.3.6 Packed Array Objects</h3>
	<p>
		A <i>packed array</i> is a more compact representation of an ordinary
		array, intended primarily for use as a procedure. A packed array
		object is distinct from an ordinary array object (it has type <i>packedarray</i>
		instead of <i>array</i>), but in most respects it behaves the same as
		an ordinary array. Its principal distinguishing feature is that it
		usually occupies much less space in memory (see Section <a
			href="../../B/2.html">B.2, "Virtual Memory Use"</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout this book, any mention of a procedure may refer to either
		an executable array or an executable packed array. The two types of
		array are not distinguishable when they are executed, only when they
		are treated as data. See the introduction to the array operators in
		Section <a href="../6.html">3.6, "Overview of Basic Operators."</a>
