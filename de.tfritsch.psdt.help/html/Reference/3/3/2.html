	<h3>3.3.2 Attributes of Objects</h3>
	<p>
		In addition to type and value, each object has one or more <i>attributes</i>.
		These attributes affect the behavior of the object when it is executed
		or when certain operations are performed on it. They do not affect its
		behavior when it is treated strictly as data; so, for example, two
		integers with the same value are considered "equal" even if their
		attributes differ.
	</p>
	<h4 id="1">Literal and Executable</h4>
	<p>
		Every object is either <i>literal</i> or <i>executable</i>. This
		distinction comes into play when the interpreter attempts to execute
		the object.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If the object is <i>literal</i>, the interpreter treats it
			strictly as data and pushes it on the operand stack for use as an
			operand of some subsequent operator.
		</li>
		<li>If the object is <i>executable</i>, the interpreter executes
			it.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		What it means to execute an object depends on the object's type; this
		is described in Section <a href="../5.html">3.5, "Execution."</a> For
		some object types, such as integers, execution consists of pushing the
		object on the operand stack; the distinction between literal and
		executable integers is meaningless. But for other types, such as
		names, operators, and arrays, execution consists of performing a
		different action.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Executing an <i>executable name</i> causes it to be looked up
			in the current dictionary context and the associated value to be
			executed.
		</li>
		<li>Executing an <i>executable operator</i> causes some built-in
			action to be performed.
		</li>
		<li>Executing an <i>executable array</i> (otherwise known as a
			procedure) causes the elements of the array to be executed in turn.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		As described in Section <a href="../2.html">3.2, "Syntax,"</a> some
		tokens produce literal objects and some produce executable ones.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Integer, real, and string constants are always literal
			objects.</li>
		<li>Names are literal if they are preceded by / and executable if
			they are not.</li>
		<li>The [ and ] operators, when executed, produce a literal array
			object with the enclosed objects as elements. Likewise, &lt;&lt; and
			&gt;&gt; <i>(LanguageLevel 2)</i> produce a literal dictionary
			object.
		</li>
		<li>{ and } enclose an executable array or procedure.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> As mentioned above, it does not matter whether an
			object is literal or executable when it is accessed as data, only
			when it is executed. However, referring to an executable object by
			name often causes that object to be executed automatically; see
			Section <a href="../5/5.html">3.5.5, "Execution of Specific
				Types."</a> To avoid unintended behavior, it is best to use the
			executable attribute only for objects that are meant to be executed,
			such as procedures.</i>
	</p>
	<h4 id="2">Access</h4>
	<p>The other attribute of an object is its access. Only composite
		objects have access attributes, which restrict the set of operations
		that can be performed on the object's value.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><i>Unlimited.</i> Normally, objects have unlimited access:
			all operations defined for that object are allowed. However, packed
			array objects always have read-only (or even more restricted) access.</li>
		<li><i>Read-only.</i> An object with read-only access may not
			have its value written, but may still be read or executed.</li>
		<li><i>Execute-only.</i> An object with execute-only access may
			not have its value either read or written, but may still be executed
			by the PostScript interpreter.</li>
		<li><i>None.</i> An object with no access may not be operated on
			in any way by a PostScript program. Such objects are not of any
			direct use to PostScript programs, but serve internal purposes that
			are not documented in this book.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The literal/executable distinction and the access attribute are
		entirely independent, although there are combinations that are not of
		any practical use (for example, a literal array that is execute-only).</p>
	<p>
		With one exception, attributes are properties of an <i>object</i>
		itself and not of its <i>value</i>. Two composite objects can share
		the same value but have different literal/executable or access
		attributes. The exception is the dictionary type: a dictionary's
		access attribute is a property of the value, so multiple dictionary
		objects sharing the same value have the same access attribute.
