	<h3>3.3.4 Boolean Objects</h3>
	<p>
		The PostScript language provides boolean objects with values <i>true</i>
		and <i>false</i> for use in conditional and logical expressions. The
		names <a href="../../8/2/f/false.html">true</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/t/true.html">false</a> are associated with values of
		this type. Boolean objects are the results of the relational
		(comparison) and logical operators. Various other operators return
		them as status information. Boolean objects are mainly used as
		operands for the control operators <a href="../../8/2/i/if.html">if</a>
		and <a href="../../8/2/i/ifelse.html">ifelse</a>.
