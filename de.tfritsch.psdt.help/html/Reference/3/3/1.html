	<h3>3.3.1 Simple and Composite Objects</h3>
	<p>Objects of most types are simple, atomic entities. An atomic
		object is always constant&mdash; a 2 is always a 2. There is no
		visible substructure in the object; the type, attributes, and value
		are irrevocably bound together and cannot be changed.</p>
	<p>
		However, objects of certain types indicated in Table 3.2 are <i>composite</i>.
		Their values are separate from the objects themselves; for some types
		of composite object, the values have internal substructure that is
		visible and can sometimes be modified selectively. The details of the
		substructures are presented later in the descriptions of these
		individual types.
	</p>
	<p>
		An important distinction between simple and composite objects is the
		behavior of operations that <i>copy</i> objects. <i>Copy</i> refers to
		any operation that transfers the contents of an object from one place
		to another in the memory of the PostScript interpreter. "Fetching" and
		"storing" objects are copying operations. It is possible to derive a
		new object by copying an existing one, perhaps with modifications.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a simple object is copied, all of its parts (type, attributes,
		and value) are copied together. When a composite object is copied, the
		value is not copied; instead, the original and copy objects <i>share</i>
		the same value. Consequently, any changes made to the substructure of
		one objectâ€™s value also appear as part of the other object's value.
	</p>
	<p>The sharing of composite objects' values in the PostScript
		language corresponds to the use of pointers in system programming
		languages such as C and Pascal. Indeed, the PostScript interpreter
		uses pointers to implement shared values: a composite object contains
		a pointer to its value. However, the PostScript language does not have
		any explicit notion of a pointer. It is better to think in terms of
		the copying and sharing notions presented here.</p>
	<p>
		The values of simple objects are contained in the objects themselves.
		The values of composite objects reside in a special region of memory
		called <i>virtual memory</i> or <i>VM</i>. Section <a href="../7.html">3.7,
			"Memory Management,"</a> describes the behavior of VM.
