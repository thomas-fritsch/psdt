	<h3>3.3.7 String Objects</h3>
	<p>
		A <i>string</i> is similar to an array, but its elements must be
		integers in the range 0 to 255. The string elements are not integer
		objects, but are stored in a more compact format. However, the
		operators that access string elements accept or return ordinary
		integer objects with values in the range 0 to 255. The length of a
		string is subject to an implementation limit; see Appendix B.
	</p>
	<p>String objects are conventionally used to hold text, one
		character per string element. However, the PostScript language does
		not have a distinct "character" syntax or data type and does not
		require that the integer elements of a string encode any particular
		character set. String objects may also be used to hold arbitrary
		binary data.</p>
	<p>
		To enhance program portability, strings appearing literally as part of
		a PostScript program should be limited to characters from the
		printable ASCII character set, with other characters inserted by means
		of the \ddd escape convention (see Section <a href="../2/2.html">3.2.2,
			"ASCII Encoding"</a>). ASCII text strings are fully portable; ASCII
		base-85 text strings are fully portable among LanguageLevel 2 and
		LanguageLevel 3 PostScript interpreters.
	</p>
	<p>Like an array, a string is a composite object. Copying a string
		object or creating a subinterval (substring) results in sharing the
		string's value.</p>
