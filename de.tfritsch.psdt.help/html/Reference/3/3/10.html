	<h3>3.3.10 Operator Objects</h3>
	<p>
		An <i>operator</i> object represents one of the PostScript language's
		built-in actions. When the object is executed, its built-in action is
		invoked. Much of this book is devoted to describing the semantics of
		the various operators.
	</p>
	<p>
		Operators have names. Most operators are associated with names in <a
			href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>: the names are the
		keys and the operators are the associated values. When the interpreter
		executes one of these names, it looks up the name in the context of
		the dictionary stack. Unless the name has been defined in some
		dictionary higher on the dictionary stack, the interpreter finds its
		definition in <a href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>,
		fetches the associated value (the operator object itself), and
		executes it.
	</p>
	<p>
		All standard operators are defined in <a
			href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>. However, an
		application that tests whether an operator is defined should not use
		the <a href="../../8/2/k/known.html">known</a> operator to determine
		whether the operator is in <a href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>;
		it should instead use the <a href="../../8/2/w/where.html">where</a>
		operator to check all dictionaries on the dictionary stack. Using <a
			href="../../8/2/w/where.html">where</a> enables proper handling of
		operator emulations (see Appendix D).
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> There are some special internal PostScript
			operators whose names begin with an at sign (@). These operators are
			not officially part of the PostScript language and are not defined in
			<a href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>. They may appear
			as an "offending command" in error messages. </i>
	</p>
	<p>
		There is nothing special about an operator name, such as <a
			href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a>, that distinguishes it as an
		operator. Rather, the name <a href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a> is
		associated in <a href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>
		with the operator for performing addition, and execution of the
		operator causes the addition to occur. Thus the name <a
			href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a> is not a "reserved word," as it
		might be in other programming languages. Its meaning can be changed by
		a PostScript program.
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout this book, the notation <a href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a>
		means "the operator object associated with the name <a
			href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a> in <a
			href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>" or, occasionally,
		in some other dictionary.
