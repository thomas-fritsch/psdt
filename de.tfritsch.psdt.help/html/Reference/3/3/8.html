	<h3>3.3.8 Name Objects</h3>
	<p>
		A <i>name</i> is an atomic symbol uniquely defined by a sequence of
		characters. Names serve the same purpose as "identifiers" in other
		programming languages: as tags for variables, procedures, and so on.
		However, PostScript names are not just language artifacts, but are
		first-class data objects, similar to "atoms" in LISP.
	</p>
	<p>
		A name object is ordinarily created when the scanner encounters a
		PostScript token consisting entirely of regular characters, perhaps
		preceded by /, as described in Section <a href="../2.html">3.2,
			"Syntax."</a> However, a name may also be created by explicit conversion
		from a string, so there is no restriction on the set of characters
		that can be included in names. The length of a name, however, is
		subject to an implementation limit; see Appendix B.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike a string, a name is a <i>simple</i> object not made up of other
		objects. Although a name is defined by a sequence of characters, those
		characters are not "elements" of the name. A name object, although
		logically simple, does have an invisible "value" that occupies space
		in VM.
	</p>
	<p>
		A name is <i>unique</i>. Any two name objects defined by the same
		sequence of characters are identical copies of each other. Name
		equality is based on an exact match between the corresponding
		characters defining each name. The case of letters must match, so the
		names A and a are different. Literal and executable objects can be
		equal, however.
	</p>
	<p>The interpreter can efficiently determine whether two existing
		name objects are equal without comparing the characters that define
		the names. This makes names useful as keys in dictionaries.</p>
	<p>
		Names do not <i>have</i> values, unlike variable or procedure names in
		other programming languages. However, names can be <i>associated</i>
		with values in dictionaries.
