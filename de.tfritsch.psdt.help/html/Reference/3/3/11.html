	<h3>3.3.11 File Objects</h3>
	<p>
		A <i>file</i> is a readable or writeable stream of characters
		transferred between the Post- Script interpreter and its environment.
		The characters in a file may be stored permanently&mdash; in a disk
		file, for instance&mdash;or may be generated dynamically and
		transferred via a communication channel.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <i>file object</i> represents a file. There are operators to open a
		file and create a file object for it. Other operators access an open
		file to read, write, and process characters in various ways&mdash;as
		strings, as PostScript tokens, as binary data represented in
		hexadecimal, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>Standard input and output files are always available to a
		PostScript program. The standard input file is the usual source of
		programs to be interpreted; the standard output file is the usual
		destination of such things as error and status messages.</p>
	<p>Although a file object does not have components visible at the
		PostScript language level, it is composite in the sense that all
		copies of a file object share the same underlying file as their value.
		If a file operator has a side effect on the underlying file, such as
		closing it or changing the current position in the stream, all file
		objects sharing the file are affected.</p>
	<p>
		The properties of files and the operations on them are described in
		more detail in Section <a href="../8.html">3.8, "File Input and
			Output."</a>
