	<h3>3.6.5 Control Operators</h3>
	<p>The control operators modify the interpreterâ€™s usual sequential
		execution of objects. Most of them take a procedure operand that they
		execute conditionally or repeatedly.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/i/if.html">if</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/i/ifelse.html">ifelse</a> execute a procedure
			conditionally depending on the value of a boolean operand. (<a
			href="../../8/2/i/ifelse.html">ifelse</a> is introduced in Section <a
			href="../5.html">3.5, "Execution."</a>)</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/e/exec.html">exec</a> executes an
			arbitrary object unconditionally.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/f/for.html">for</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/repeat.html">repeat</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/l/loop.html">loop</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/f/forall.html">forall</a> execute a procedure
			repeatedly. Several specialized graphics and font operators, such as
			<a href="../../8/2/p/pathforall.html">pathforall</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/k/kshow.html">kshow</a>, behave similarly.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/e/exit.html">exit</a> transfers control
			out of the scope of any of these looping operators.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/countexecstack.html">countexecstack</a>
			and <a href="../../8/2/e/execstack.html">execstack</a> are used to
			read the execution stack.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		A PostScript program may terminate prematurely by executing the <a
			href="../../8/2/s/stop.html">stop</a> operator. This occurs most
		commonly as a result of an error; the default error handlers (in <a
			href="../../8/2/e/errordict.html">errordict</a>) all execute <a
			href="../../8/2/s/stop.html">stop</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/s/stopped.html">stopped</a> operator
		establishes an execution environment that encapsulates the effect of a
		<a href="../../8/2/s/stop.html">stop</a>. That is, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/stopped.html">stopped</a> executes a procedure
		given as an operand, just the same as <a href="../../8/2/e/exec.html">exec</a>.
		If the interpreter executes <a href="../../8/2/s/stop.html">stop</a>
		during that procedure, it terminates the procedure and resumes
		execution at the object immediately after the <a
			href="../../8/2/s/stopped.html">stopped</a> operator.
