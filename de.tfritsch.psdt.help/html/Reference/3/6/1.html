	<h3>3.6.1 Stack Operators</h3>
	<p>
		The operand stack is the PostScript interpreter's mechanism for
		passing arguments to operators and for gathering results from
		operators. It is introduced in Section <a href="../4.html">3.4,
			"Stacks."</a>
	</p>
	<p>There are various operators that rearrange or manipulate the
		objects on the operand stack. Such rearrangement is often required
		when the results of some operators are to be used as arguments to
		other operators that require their operands in a different order.
		These operators manipulate only the objects themselves; they do not
		copy the values of composite objects.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/d/dup.html">dup</a> duplicates an object.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/e/exch.html">exch</a> exchanges the top
			two elements of the stack.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/p/pop.html">pop</a> removes the top
			element from the stack.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/copy.html">copy</a> duplicates portions
			of the operand stack.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/r/roll.html">roll</a> treats a portion of
			the stack as a circular queue.
		<li><a href="../../8/2/i/index.html">index</a> accesses the stack
			as if it were an indexable array.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/m/mark.html">mark</a> marks a position on
			the stack.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/clear.html">clear</a> clears the stack.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/count.html">count</a> counts the number
			of elements on the stack.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/counttomark.html">counttomark</a> counts
			the elements above the highest mark. This is used primarily for array
			construction (described later), but has other applications as well.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/cleartomark.html">cleartomark</a>
			reremoves all elements above the highest mark and then removes the
			mark itself.</li>
	</ul>
