	<h3>3.6.3 Array, Packed Array, Dictionary, and String Operators</h3>
	<p>A number of operators are polymorphic: they may be applied to
		operands of several different types and their precise functions depend
		on the types of the operands. Except where indicated otherwise, the
		operators listed below apply to any of the following types of
		composite objects: arrays, packed arrays, dictionaries, and strings.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/g/get.html">get</a> takes a composite
			object and an index (or a key, in the case of a dictionary) and
			returns a single element of the object.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/p/put.html">put</a> stores a single
			element in an array, dictionary, or string. This operator does not
			apply to packed array objects, because they always have read-only (or
			even more restrictive) access.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/c/copy.html">copy</a> copies the value of
			a composite object to another composite object of the same type,
			replacing the second object's former value. This is different from
			merely copying the object. See Section <a href="../3/1.html">3.3.1,
				"Simple and Composite Objects"</a> for a discussion of copying objects.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/l/length.html">length</a> returns the
			number of elements in a composite object.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/f/forall.html">forall</a> accesses all of
			the elements of a composite object in sequence, calling a procedure
			for each one.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/g/getinterval.html">getinterval</a>
			creates a new object that shares a subinterval of an array, a packed
			array, or a string. This operator does not apply to dictionary
			objects.</li>
		<li><a href="../../8/2/p/putinterval.html">putinterval</a>
			overwrites a subinterval of one array or string with the contents of
			another. This operator does not apply to dictionary or packed array
			objects, although it can overwrite a subinterval of an array with the
			contents of a packed array.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In addition to the polymorphic operators, there are operators that
		apply to only one of the array, packed array, dictionary, and string
		types. For each type, there is an operator (<a
			href="../../8/2/a/array.html">array</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/p/packedarray.html">packedarray</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/d/dict.html">dict</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/s/string.html">string</a>) that creates a new object
		of that type and a specified length. These four operators explicitly
		create new composite object values, consuming virtual memory (VM)
		resources (see Section <a href="../7/1.html">3.7.1, "Virtual
			Memory"</a>). Most other operators read and write the values of composite
		objects but do not create new ones. Operators that return composite
		results usually require an operand that is the composite object into
		which the result values are to be stored. The operators are organized
		this way to give programmers maximum control over consumption of VM.
	</p>
	<p>Array, packed array, and string objects have a fixed length that
		is specified when the object is created. In LanguageLevel 1,
		dictionary objects also have this property. In LanguageLevels 2 and 3,
		a dictionary's capacity can grow beyond its initial allocation.</p>
