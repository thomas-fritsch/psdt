	<h2>3.4 Stacks</h2>
	<p>The PostScript interpreter manages five stacks representing the
		execution state of a PostScript program. Three of them&mdash;the
		operand, dictionary, and execution stacks&mdash;are described here;
		the other two—the graphics state stack and clipping path stack—are
		presented in Chapter 4. Stacks are "last in, first out" (LIFO) data
		structures. In this book, “the stack” with no qualifier always means
		the operand stack.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <em>operand stack</em> holds arbitrary PostScript objects
			that are the operands and results of PostScript operators being
			executed. The interpreter pushes objects on the operand stack when it
			encounters them as literal data in a program being executed. When an
			operator requires one or more operands, it obtains them by popping
			them off the top of the operand stack. When an operator returns one
			or more results, it does so by pushing them on the operand stack.
		</li>
		<li>The <em>dictionary stack</em> holds only dictionary objects.
			The current set of dictionaries on the dictionary stack defines the
			environment for all implicit name searches, such as those that occur
			when the interpreter encounters an executable name. The role of the
			dictionary stack is introduced in Section 3.3, "Data Types and
			Objects," and is further explained in Section 3.5, "Execution."
		</li>
		<li>The <em>execution stack</em> holds executable objects (mainly
			procedures and files) that are in intermediate stages of execution.
			At any point in the execution of a Post- Script program, this stack
			represents the program’s call stack. Whenever the interpreter
			suspends execution of an object to execute some other object, it
			pushes the new object on the execution stack. When the interpreter
			finishes executing an object, it pops that object off the execution
			stack and resumes executing the suspended object beneath it.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The three stacks are independent and there are different ways to
		access each of them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The operand stack is directly under the control of the
			PostScript program being executed. Objects may be pushed and popped
			arbitrarily by various operators.</li>
		<li>The dictionary stack is also under PostScript program
			control, but it can hold only dictionaries. The bottom three
			dictionaries on the stack&mdash;<b>systemdict</b>, <b>globaldict</b>,
			and <b>userdict</b>&mdash;(or the bottom two, in LanguageLevel 1)
			cannot be popped off. The only operators that can alter the
			dictionary stack are <b>begin</b>, <b>end</b>, and <b>cleardictstack</b>.
		</li>
		<li>The execution stack is under the control of the PostScript
			interpreter. It can be read but not directly modified by a PostScript
			program.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When an object is pushed on a stack, the object is copied onto
		the stack from wherever it was obtained; however, in the case of a
		composite object (such as an array, a string, or a dictionary), the
		object’s value is not copied onto the stack, but rather is shared with
		the original object. Similarly, when a composite object is popped off
		a stack and put somewhere, only the object itself is moved, not its
		value. See Section 3.3, "Data Types and Objects," for more details.</p>
	<p>The maximum capacity of stacks may be limited; see Appendices B
		and C.</p>
