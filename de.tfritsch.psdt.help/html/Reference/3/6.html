	<h2>3.6 Overview of Basic Operators</h2>
	<p>This is an overview of the general-purpose PostScript operators,
		excluding all operators that deal with graphics and fonts, which are
		described in later chapters. The information here is insufficient for
		actual programming; it is intended only to acquaint you with the
		available facilities. For complete information about any particular
		operator, you should refer to the operator's detailed description in
		Chapter 8.</p>
