	<h2>3.13.2 End-of-Data and End-of-File</h2>
	<p>
		A filter can reach a state in which it cannot continue filtering data.
		This is called the <i>end-of-data</i> (EOD) condition. Most decoding
		(input) filters can detect an EOD marker encoded in the data they are
		reading. The nature of this marker depends on the filter. Most
		encoding (output) filters append an EOD marker to the data they are
		writing. This generally occurs automatically when the filter file is
		closed. In a few instances, the EOD condition is based on
		predetermined information, such as a byte count or a line count,
		rather than on an explicit marker in the encoded data.
	</p>
	<p>
		A file object, including a filter, can be closed at an arbitrary time,
		and a readable file can run out of data. This is called the <i>end-of-file</i>
		(EOF) condition. When a decoding filter detects EOD and all the
		decoded data has been read, the filter reaches the EOF condition. The
		underlying data source or target for a filter can itself reach EOF.
		This usually results in the filter reaching EOF, perhaps after some
		delay.
	</p>
	<p>For efficient operation, filters must be buffered. The
		PostScript interpreter automatically provides buffering as part of the
		filter file object. Because of the effects of buffering, the filter
		reads from its data source or writes to its data target at irregular
		times, not necessarily each time the filter file itself is read or
		written. Also, many filtering algorithms require an unpredictable
		amount of state to be held within the filter object.</p>
