	<h4>CloseSource and CloseTarget</h4>
	<p>
		<b>CloseSource</b> and <b>CloseTarget</b> <i>(both LanguageLevel
			3)</i> are optional boolean parameters in the parameter dictionary for
		decoding and encoding filters, respectively. These parameters govern
		the disposition of the filter's data source or target when the <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/closefile.html">closefile</a> operator is
		applied to the filter explicitly, or implicitly in one of the
		following ways: by the <a href="../../../8/2/r/restore.html">restore</a>
		operator, by garbage collection, or (except for the <b>ReusableStreamDecode</b>
		filter) by reaching EOD.
	</p>
	<p>
		If <b>CloseSource</b> or <b>CloseTarget</b> is <i>false</i> (as they
		are by default), no additional action is taken on the data source or
		target; this is the behavior in LanguageLevel 2. However, if the
		parameter is <i>true</i>, then after <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/closefile.html">closefile</a> has been applied
		to the filter, it is also applied to the filter's data source or
		target. This process propagates through an entire pipeline, unless a
		filter is reached whose <b>CloseSource</b> or <b>CloseTarget</b>
		parameter is <i>false</i>; that filter is closed, but its source or
		target is not.
