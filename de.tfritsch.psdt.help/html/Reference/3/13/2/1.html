	<h4>Decoding Filters</h4>
	<p>Before encountering EOD, a decoding filter reads an
		unpredictable amount of data from its data source. However, when it
		encounters EOD, it stops reading from its data source. If the data
		source is a file, encoded data that is properly terminated by EOD can
		be followed by additional unencoded data, which a program can then
		read directly from that file.</p>
	<p>
		When a filter reaches EOD and all the decoded data has been read from
		it, the filter file reaches EOF and is closed automatically. Automatic
		closing of input files at EOF is a standard feature of <i>all</i> file
		objects, not just of filters. (The <b>ReusableStreamDecode</b> filter
		is an exception; see <a href="../3/9.html">"ReusableStreamDecode
			Filter" on page 153</a>.) Unlike other file objects, a filter reaches EOF
		and is closed immediately after the last data character is read from
		it, rather than at the following attempt to read a character. A filter
		also reaches EOF if its data source runs out of data by reaching EOF.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Data for a filter must be terminated by an
			explicit EOD, even if the program reading from the filter (executing
			the <a href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator, for
			example) reads only the exact amount of data that is present.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Applying <a href="../../../8/2/f/flushfile.html">flushfile</a> to a
		decoding filter causes data to be drawn from the data source until the
		filter reaches EOD or the source runs out of data, whichever occurs
		first. This operator can be used to flush the remainder of the encoded
		data from the underlying file when the reading of filtered data must
		be terminated prematurely. After the <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/flushfile.html">flushfile</a> operation, the
		underlying file is positioned so that the next read from that file
		will begin immediately following the EOD of the encoded data. If a
		program closes a decoding filter prematurely before it reaches EOD and
		without explicitly flushing it, the data source will be in an
		indeterminate state. Because of buffering, there is no dependable way
		to predict how much data will have been consumed from the data source.
