	<h4>Encoding Filters</h4>
	<p>As stated earlier, writing to an encoding (output) filter causes
		it to write encoded data to its data target. However, because of the
		effects of buffering, the writes to the data target occur at
		unpredictable times. The only way to ensure that all encoded data has
		been written is to close the filter.</p>
	<p>Most encoding filters can accept an indefinite amount of data to
		be encoded. The amount usually is not specified in advance. Closing
		the filter causes an EOD marker to be written to the data target at
		the end of the encoded data. The nature of the EOD marker depends on
		the filter being used; it is sometimes under the control of parameters
		specified when the filter is created.</p>
	<p>
		The <b>DCTEncode</b> filter requires the amount of data to be
		specified in advance, when the filter is created. When that amount of
		data has been encoded, the filter reaches the EOD condition
		automatically. Attempting to write additional data to the filter
		causes an <a href="../../../8/2/i/ioerror.html">ioerror</a>, possibly
		after some delay.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some data targets can become unable to accept further data. For
		instance, if the data target is a string, the string may become full.
		If the data target is a file, the file may become closed. Attempting
		to write to a filter whose data target cannot accept data causes an <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/ioerror.html">ioerror</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Applying <a href="../../../8/2/f/flushfile.html">flushfile</a> to an
		encoding filter file causes the filter to flush buffered data to its
		data target to the extent possible. If the data target is a file, <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/flushfile.html">flushfile</a> is also invoked
		for it. The effect of <a href="../../../8/2/f/flushfile.html">flushfile</a>
		will propagate all the way down a filter pipeline. However, because of
		the nature of filter algorithms, it is not possible to guarantee that
		all data stored as part of a filter's internal state will be flushed.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the other hand, applying <a href="../../../8/2/c/closefile.html">closefile</a>
		to an encoding filter flushes both the buffered data and the filter's
		internal state. This causes all encoded data to be written to the data
		target, followed by an EOD marker, if appropriate.
	</p>
	<p>When a program closes a pipeline consisting of two or more
		encoding filters, it must close each component filter file in
		sequence, starting with the one that was created last (in other words,
		the one farthest upstream). This ensures that all buffered data and
		all appropriate EOD markers are written in the proper order.</p>
	<p>
		If a filter file object is reclaimed by <a
			href="../../../8/2/r/restore.html">restore</a> or garbage collection
		before being closed, it is closed automatically (as is the case for
		all file objects); however, no attempt is made to close a filter
		pipeline in the correct order. Errors arising from closing in the
		wrong order are ignored, and filter target procedures are not called.
