	<h4>ReusableStreamDecode Filter</h4>
	<pre>source /ReusableStreamDecode filter
source dictionary /ReusableStreamDecode filter</pre>
	<p>Certain PostScript features require that large blocks of data be
		available, in their entirety, for use one or more times during the
		invocation of those features. Examples of such data blocks include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Data for a sampled function (see Section <a
			href="../../../3/10.html">3.10, "Functions"</a>)
		</li>
		<li>Image data or encapsulated PostScript (EPS) referenced from
			the PaintProc procedure of a form dictionary (see Section <a
			href="../../../4/7.html">4.7, "Forms"</a>)
		</li>
		<li>Mesh data for shading dictionaries (see Section <a
			href="../../../4/9/3.html">4.9.3, "Shading Patterns"</a>)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Such data can be stored in strings, but only if the amount of data is
		less than the implementation limit imposed on string objects. (See
		Appendix <a href="../../../B.html">B</a> for implementation limits.)
		To overcome this limit, LanguageLevel 3 defines <i>reusable
			streams</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A reusable stream is a file object produced by a <b>ReusableStreamDecode</b>
		filter. Conceptually, this filter consumes all of its source data at
		the time the <a href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a> operator
		is invoked and then makes the data available as if it were contained
		in a temporary file. The filter file can be positioned as if it were a
		random-access disk file; its capacity is limited only by the amount of
		storage available.
	</p>
	<p>
		Except for <b>ReusableStreamDecode</b> filters, a decoding filter is
		an input file that can be read only once. When it reaches EOF, it is
		automatically closed, and no further data can be read from it. No data
		is read from the filter's source during the execution of the <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a> operator.
	</p>
	<p>
		In contrast, a <b>ReusableStreamDecode</b> filter is an input file
		that can be read many times. When it reaches EOF, it does not
		automatically close, but merely stays at EOF. It can be repositioned,
		when it reaches EOF or at any other time, for further reading. In some
		cases, <i>all</i> of the data is read from the filter's source during
		the execution of the <a href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a>
		operator.
	</p>
	<p>
		A reusable stream has a <i>length</i>, which is the total number of
		bytes in its data source. The stream can be positioned anywhere from
		0, which denotes the beginning of the stream, to <i>length</i>, which
		denotes the EOF.
	</p>
	<p>When data is read from the filter's source, it may or may not be
		buffered in memory or written to a temporary disk file, depending on
		the type of data source, the availability of storage, and details of
		the implementation and system memory management.</p>
	<p>
		The <b>AsyncRead</b> flag in the filter's parameter dictionary
		specifies whether all of the data should be read from the data source
		during the execution of the <a href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a>
		operator (<b>AsyncRead</b> <i>false</i>, the default), or whether this
		may be postponed until the data is needed (<b>AsyncRead</b> <i>true</i>).
		Asynchronous reading may require less memory or have better
		performance, but caution is required: attempts to read from the same
		data source through a separate stream may produce incorrect results.
	</p>
	<p>
		Regardless of the value of <b>AsyncRead</b>, a string or file that is
		used as the data source for a reusable stream, as for any other
		decoding filter, should be considered read-only until the stream is
		closed. Writing into such a string or file will have unpredictable
		consequences for the data read from the stream.
	</p>
	<p>
		A reusable stream's parameter dictionary can also specify additional
		filters that are to be applied to the data source before it is read by
		the <b>ReusableStreamDecode</b> filter. This has an effect equivalent
		to supplying the same filter pipeline as the data source of the <b>ReusableStreamDecode</b>
		filter. However, specifying those filters in the <b>ReusableStreamDecode</b>
		filter dictionary can improve efficiency by allowing the
		implementation more flexibility in determining how to read and buffer
		the data.
	</p>
	<p>The following operators can be applied to a reusable stream:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../../../8/2/c/closefile.html">closefile</a> closes
			the file. This occurs implicitly when the file is reclaimed by the <a
			href="../../../8/2/r/restore.html">restore</a> operator or garbage
			collection. Closing the file reclaims any temporary memory or disk
			space that was used to buffer the file's contents.</li>
		<li><a href="../../../8/2/f/fileposition.html">fileposition</a>
			returns the current file position. The result is always in the range
			0 to <i>length</i>.</li>
		<li><a href="../../../8/2/s/setfileposition.html">setfileposition</a>
			sets the file position to a value in the range 0 to <i>length</i>.</li>
		<li><a href="../../../8/2/r/resetfile.html">resetfile</a> sets
			the file position to 0.</li>
		<li><a href="../../../8/2/f/flushfile.html">flushfile</a> sets
			the file position to <i>length</i>.</li>
		<li><a href="../../../8/2/b/bytesavailable.html">bytesavailable</a>
			returns <i>length</i> minus the current file position.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Table 3.24 lists the entries in the ReusableStreamDecode
		parameter dictionary.</p>

		</tr>
		<tr id="Filter">
			<th>Filter</th>
			<td>array or name</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> An array of names of decoding filters that
				are to be applied before delivering data to the reader. The names
				must be specified in the order they should be applied to decode the
				data. For example, data encoded using LZW and then ASCII base-85
				encoding filters should be decoded with the <b>Filter</b> value
				[/ASCII85Decode /LZWDecode]. If only one filter is required, the
				value of Filter may be the name of that filter.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="DecodeParms">
			<th>DecodeParms</th>
			<td>array or dictionary</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> An array of parameter dictionaries used by
				the decoding filters dictionary that are specified by the Filter
				parameter, listed in the same order. If a filter requires no
				parameters, the corresponding item in the <b>DecodeParms</b> array
				must be <b>null</b>. If the value of <b>Filter</b> is a name, <b>DecodeParms</b>
				must be the parameter dictionary for that filter. If no parameters
				are required for any of the decoding filters, <b>DecodeParms</b> may
				be omitted.<br /> Note that the <b>SubFileDecode</b> filter
				requires a parameter dictionary with entries for both <b>EODCount</b>
				and <b>EODString</b>. <br />All occurrences of <b>CloseSource</b>
				in the parameter dictionaries are ignored. When the reusable stream
				is closed, all the filters are also closed, independent of the value
				of <b>CloseSource</b> in the reusable stream itself. The original
				source of the reusable stream is closed only if the value of <b>CloseSource</b>
				in the reusable stream is <i>true</i>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="Intent">
			<th>Intent</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A code representing the intended use of
				the reusable stream, which may help optimize the data storage or
				caching strategy. If the value is omitted or is not one of the
				following values, the default value of 0 is used.
				<dl>
					<dt>0</dt>
					<dd>Image data</dd>
					<dt>1</dt>
					<dd>Image mask data</dd>
					<dt>2</dt>
					<dd>Sequentially accessed lookup table data (such as a

						values for a sampled function)</dd>
				</dl></td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="AsyncRead">
			<th>AsyncRead</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A flag that controls when data from the
				source is to be read. If <i>false</i>, all the data from the source
				is read when the filter is created. If <i>true</i>, data from the
				source may or may not be read when the filter is created; reading
				may be postponed until the data is needed. Any operation on the
				filter may cause all of the data to be read. Default value: <i>false</i>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="CloseSource">
			<th>CloseSource</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A flag specifying whether closing the
