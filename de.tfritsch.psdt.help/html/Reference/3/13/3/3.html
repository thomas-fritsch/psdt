		The <b>LZWDecode</b> filter decodes data that is encoded in a
		Lempel-Ziv-Welch compressed format. See the description of the <b>LZWEncode</b>
		filter for details of the format and a description of the filter
		parameters.
	</p>
	<p>
		The parameter dictionary can be used to specify the <b>CloseSource</b>
		parameter <i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i>.

	<p>
		The <b>LZWEncode</b> filter encodes ASCII or binary data according to
		the basic LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) data compression method. LZW is a
		variable-length, adaptive compression method that has been adopted as
		one of the standard compression methods in the <i>tag image file
			format</i> (TIFF) standard. The output produced by the <b>LZWEncode</b>
		filter is always binary, even if the input is ASCII text.
	</p>
	<p>
		LZW compression can discover and exploit many patterns in its input
		data. In its basic form, it is especially well suited to
		natural-language and PostScriptlanguage text. The filter also supports
		optional pretransformation by a predictor function, as described in
		the section <a href="./???">"Predictor Functions" on page 139</a>;
		this improves compression of sampled image data.
	</p>

	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 3, the size of the units encoded is determined by the
		optional <b>UnitLength</b> entry in the <b>LZWDecode</b> parameter
		dictionary; its default value is 8. The following general discussion
		of the encoding scheme refers to this LanguageLevel 3 parameter; for
		LanguageLevel 2, assume a unit size of 8.
	</p>
	<p>
		The encoded data consists of a sequence of codes that can be from (<b>UnitLength</b>
		+ 1) to a maximum of 12 bits long. Each code denotes a single
		character of input data (0 to 2<sup><b>UnitLength</b></sup> - 1), a
		clear-table marker (2<sup><b>UnitLength</b></sup>), an EOD marker (2<sup><b>UnitLength</b></sup>
		+ 1), or a table entry representing a multicharacter sequence that has
		been encountered previously in the input (2<sup><b>UnitLength</b></sup>
		+ 2 and greater). In the normal case where <b>UnitLength</b> is 8, the
		clear-table marker is 256 and the EOD marker is 257.
	</p>
	<p>
		Initially, the code length is (<b>UnitLength</b> + 1) bits and the
		table contains only entries for the ((2<sup><b>UnitLength</b></sup> +
		2) fixed codes. As encoding proceeds, entries are appended to the
		table, associating new codes with longer and longer input character
		sequences. The encoding and decoding filters maintain identical copies
		of this table.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever both the encoder and decoder independently (but
		synchronously) realize that the current code length is no longer
		sufficient to represent the number of entries in the table, they
		increase the number of bits per code by 1. For a <b>UnitLength</b> of
		8, the first output code that is 10 bits long is the one following the
		creation of table entry 511, and so on for 11 (1023) and 12 (2047)
		bits. Codes are never longer than 12 bits, so entry 4095 is the last
		entry of the LZW table.
	</p>
	<p>The encoder executes the following sequence of steps to generate
		each output code:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Accumulate a sequence of one or more input characters
			matching some sequence already present in the table. For maximum
			compression, the encoder should find the longest such sequence.</li>
		<li>Emit the code corresponding to that sequence.</li>
		<li>Create a new table entry for the first unused code. Its value
			is the sequence found in step 1 followed by the next input character.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For example, suppose UnitLength is 8 and the input consists of
		the following sequence of ASCII character codes:</p>
	<pre>45 45 45 45 45 65 45 45 45 66</pre>
	<p>Starting with an empty table, the encoder proceeds as shown in
		Table 3.18.</p>

	</table>
	<p>
		Codes are packed into a continuous bit stream, high-order bit first
		(assuming that <b>LowBitFirst</b> is <i>false</i>). This stream is
		then divided into 8-bit bytes, high-order bit first. Thus, codes can
		straddle byte boundaries arbitrarily. After the EOD marker (code value
		of 257), any leftover bits in the final byte are set to 0.
	</p>
	<p>In the example above, all the output codes are 9 bits long; they
		would pack into bytes as follows (represented in hexadecimal):</p>
	<pre>80 0B 60 50 22 0C 0E 02</pre>
	<p>To adapt to changing input sequences, the encoder may at any
		point issue a clear-table code, which causes both the encoder and
		decoder to restart with initial tables and 9-bit codes. By convention,
		the encoder begins by issuing a clear-table code. It must issue a
		clear-table code when the table becomes full; it may do so sooner.</p>
