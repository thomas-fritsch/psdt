	<p>
		The <b>DCTDecode</b> filter decodes grayscale or color image data in
		JPEG baseline encoded format. The description of the <b>DCTEncode</b>
		filter provides details of the format and the related filter
		parameters. All of the <b>DCTEncode</b> parameters (except <b>CloseTarget</b>)
		are allowed for <b>DCTDecode</b>; however, usually no parameters are
		needed except <b>ColorTransform</b> (and possibly <b>CloseSource</b>,
		in LanguageLevel 3), because all information required for decoding an
		image is normally contained in the JPEG signalling parameters, which
		accompany the encoded data in the compressed data stream.
	</p>
	<p>
		The decoded data is a stream of image samples, each of which consists
		of 1, 2, 3, or 4 color components, interleaved on a per-sample basis.
		Each component value occupies one 8-bit byte. The dimensions of the
		image and the number of components per sample depend on parameters
		that were specified when the image was encoded. Given suitable
		parameters, the <a href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator
		can consume data directly from a <b>DCTDecode</b> filter.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The JPEG standard also allows an image's
			components to be sent as separate scans instead of interleaved;
			however, that format is not useful with the <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator, because <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> requires that components
			from separate sources be read in parallel.</i>

	<p>
		The <b>DCTEncode</b> filter encodes grayscale or color image data in
		JPEG baseline format. JPEG is the ISO Joint Photographic Experts
		Group, an organization responsible for developing an international
		standard for compression of color image data (see the Bibliography).
		Another informal abbreviation for this standard is JFIF, for JPEG File
		Interchange Format. DCT refers to the primary technique (discrete
		cosine transform) used in the encoding and decoding algorithms. The
		algorithm can achieve very impressive compression of color images. For
		example, at a compression ratio of 10 to 1, there is little or no
		perceptible degradation in quality.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> The compression algorithm is "lossy," meaning that
			the data produced by the <b>DCTDecode</b> filter is not exactly the
			same as the data originally encoded by the <b>DCTEncode</b> filter.
			These filters are designed specifically for compression of sampled
			continuous-tone images, not for general data compression.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Input to the <b>DCTEncode</b> filter is a stream of image samples,
		each of which consists of 1, 2, 3, or 4 color components, interleaved
		on a per-sample basis. Each component value occupies one 8-bit byte.
		The dimensions of the image and the number of components per sample
		must be specified in the filter's parameter dictionary. The dictionary
		can also contain other optional parameters that control the operation
		of the encoding algorithm. Table 3.22 describes the contents of this
		dictionary.

		<tr id="HSamples">
			<th>HSamples</th>
			<td>array, packed array or string</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A sequence of horizontal sampling factors
				(one per color component). If <b>HSamples</b> is an array or a
				packed array, the elements must be integers; if it is a string, the
				elements are interpreted as integers in the range 0 to 255. The <i>i</i>th
				element of the sequence specifies the sampling factor for the <i>i</i>th
				color component. Allowed sampling factors are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The
				default value is an array containing 1 for all components, meaning
				that all components are to be sampled at the same rate.<br /> When
				the sampling factors are not all the same, <b>DCTEncode</b>
				subsamples the image for those components whose sampling factors are
				less than the largest one. For example, if <b>HSamples</b> is [4 3 2
				1] for a 4-color image, then for every 4 horizontal samples of the
				first component, <b>DCTEncode</b> sends only 3 samples of the second
				component, 2 of the third, and 1 of the fourth. However, <b>DCTDecode</b>
				inverts this sampling process so that it produces the same amount of
				data as was presented to <b>DCTEncode</b>. In other words, this
				parameter affects only the encoded, and not the unencoded or
				decoded, representation. The filters deal correctly with the
				situation in which the width or height of the image is not a
				multiple of the corresponding sampling factor.</td>

		<tr id="VSamples">
			<th>VSamples</th>
			<td>array, packed array or string</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A sequence of vertical sampling factors
				(one per color component). Interpretation and default value are the
				same as for <b>HSamples</b>.<br />The JPEG standard imposes a
				restriction on the values in the <b>HSamples</b> and <b>VSamples</b>
				sequences, taken together: For each color component, multiply its <b>HSamples</b>
				value by its <b>VSamples</b> value, then add all of the products
				together. The result must not exceed 10.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="QuantTables">
			<th>QuantTables</th>
			<td>array or packed array</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> An array or packed array of quantization
				tables (one per color component). The <i>i</i>th element of <b>QuantTables</b>
				is the table to be used, after scaling by <b>QFactor</b>, for
				quantization of the <i>i</i>th color component. As many as four
				unique quantization tables can be specified, but several elements of
				the <b>QuantTables</b> array can refer to the same table.<br />
				Each table must be an array, a packed array, or a string. If it is
				an array or a packed array, the elements must be numbers; if it is a
				string, the elements are interpreted as integers in the range 0 to
				255. In either case, each table must contain 64 numbers organized
				according to the zigzag pattern defined by the JPEG standard. After
				scaling by <b>QFactor</b>, every element is rounded to the nearest
				integer in the range 1 to 255. Default value:
				implementation-dependent.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="QFactor">
			<th>QFactor</th>
			<td>number</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A scale factor applied to the elements of
				QuantTables. This parameter enables straightforward adjustment of
				the tradeoff between image compression and image quality without
				respecifying the quantization tables. Valid values are in the range
				0 to 1,000,000. A value less than 1 improves image quality but
				decreases compression; a value greater than 1 increases compression
				but degrades image quality. Default value: 1.0.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="HuffTables">
			<th>HuffTables</th>
			<td>array or packed array</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> An array or packed array of at least 2
				&times; <b>Colors</b> encoding tables. The pair of tables at indices
				2 &times; <i>i</i> and 2 &times; <i>i</i> + 1 in <b>HuffTables</b>
				are used to construct Huffman tables for coding the <i>i</i>th color
				component. The first table in each pair is used for the DC
				coefficients, the second for the AC coefficients. At most two DC
				tables and two AC tables can be specified, but several elements of
				the <b>HuffTables</b> array can refer to the same tables. Default
				value: implementation-dependent.<br /> Each table must be an array,
				a packed array, or a string. If it is an array or a packed array,
				the elements must be numbers; if it is a string, the elements are
				interpreted as integers in the range 0 to 255. The first 16 values
				specify the number of codes of each length from 1 to 16 bits. The
				remaining values are the symbols corresponding to each code; they
				are given in order of increasing code length. This information is
				sufficient to construct a Huffman coding table according to an
				algorithm given in the JPEG standard. A <b>QFactor</b> value other
				than 1.0 may alter this computation.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="ColorTransform">
			<th>ColorTransform</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A code specifying a transformation to be
				performed on the sample values:
				<dl>
					<dt>0</dt>
					<dd>No transformation.</dd>
					<dt>1</dt>
					<dd>
						If <b>Colors</b> is 3, transform RGB values to YUV before encoding
						and from YUV to RGB after decoding. If <b>Colors</b> is 4,
						transform CMYK values to YUVK before encoding and from YUVK to
						CMYK after decoding. This option is ignored if <b>Colors</b> is 1
						or 2.
					</dd>
				</dl> If performed, these transformations occur entirely within the <b>DCTEncode</b>
				and <b>DCTDecode</b> filters. The RGB and YUV used here have nothing
				to do with the color spaces defined as part of the Adobe imaging
				model. The purpose of converting from RGB to YUV is to separate
				luminance and chrominance information (see below).<br /> The
				default value of <b>ColorTransform</b> is 1 if <b>Colors</b> is 3
				and 0 otherwise. In other words, conversion between RGB and YUV is
				performed for all three-component images unless explicitly disabled
				by setting <b>ColorTransform</b> to 0. Additionally, the <b>DCTEncode</b>
				filter inserts an Adobe-defined marker code in the encoded data
				indicating the <b>ColorTransform</b> value used. If present, this
				marker code overrides the <b>ColorTransform</b> value given to <b>DCTDecode</b>.
				Thus it is necessary to specify <b>ColorTransform</b> only when
				decoding data that does not contain the Adobe-defined marker code.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="CloseTarget">
			<th>CloseTarget</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td><i>(Optional; LanguageLevel 3)</i> A flag specifying whether
				closing the filter should also close its data target. Default value:
				<i>false</i>.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>
		Specifying the optional parameters properly requires understanding the
		details of the encoding algorithm, which is described in the JPEG
		standard. The <b>DCTDecode</b> and <b>DCTEncode</b> filters do not
		support certain features of the standard that are irrelevant to images
		following PostScript language conventions; in particular, progressive
		JPEG is not supported. Additionally, Adobe has made certain choices
		regarding reserved marker codes and other optional features of the
		standard; contact the Adobe Developers Association for further
		information.
	</p>
	<p>
		The default values for <b>QuantTables</b> and <b>HuffTables</b> in a <b>DCTEncode</b>
		parameter dictionary are chosen without reference to the image color
		space and without specifying any particular tradeoff between image
		quality and compression. Although they will work, they will not
		produce optimal results for most applications. For superior
		compression, applications should provide custom <b>QuantTables</b> and
		<b>HuffTables</b> arrays rather than relying on the default values.
	</p>
	<p>Better compression is often possible for color spaces that treat
		luminance and chrominance separately than for those that do not. The
		RGB to YUV conversion provided by the filters is one attempt to
		separate luminance and chrominance; it conforms to CCIR recommendation
		601-1. Other color spaces, such as the CIE 1976 L*a*b* space, may also
		achieve this objective. The chrominance components can then be
		compressed more than the luminance by using coarser sampling or
		quantization, with no degradation in quality.</p>
	<p>
		Unlike other encoding filters, the <b>DCTEncode</b> filter requires
		that a specific amount of data be written to it: <b>Columns</b>
		&times; <b>Rows</b> samples of <b>Colors</b> bytes each. The filter
		reaches EOD at that point. It cannot accept further data, so
		attempting to write to it will cause an <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/ioerror.html">ioerror</a>. The program must now
		close the filter file to cause the buffered data and EOD marker to be
		flushed to the data target.
