	</pre>
	<p>
		The <b>SubFileDecode</b> filter does not perform data transformation,
		but it can detect an EOD condition. Its output is always identical to
		its input, up to the point where EOD occurs. The data preceding the
		EOD is called a <i>subfile</i> of the underlying data source.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>SubFileDecode</b> filter can be used in a variety of ways:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A subfile can contain data that should be read or executed
			conditionally, depending on information that is not known until
			execution. If a program decides to ignore the information in a
			subfile, it can easily skip to the end of the subfile by invoking <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/flushfile.html">flushfile</a> on the filter
			file.
		</li>
		<li>Subfiles can help recover from errors that occur in
			encapsulated programs. If the encapsulated program is treated as a
			subfile, the enclosing program can regain control if an error occurs,
			flush to the end of the subfile, and resume execution from the
			underlying data source. The application, not the PostScript
			interpreter, must provide such error handling; it is not the default
			error handling provided by the PostScript interpreter.</li>
		<li>The <b>SubFileDecode</b> filter enables an arbitrary data
			source (procedure or string) to be treated as an input file. This use
			of subfiles does not require detection of an EOD marker.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The <b>SubFileDecode</b> filter requires two parameters, <i>EODCount</i>
		and <i>EODString</i>, which specify the condition under which the
		filter is to recognize EOD. The filter will allow data to pass through
		the filter until it has encountered exactly <i>EODCount</i> instances
		of the <i>EODString</i>; then it will reach EOD.
	</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 2, <i>EODCount</i> and <i>EODString</i> are specified
		as operands on the stack. In LanguageLevel 3, they may alternatively
		be specified in the <b>SubFileDecode</b> parameter dictionary (as
		shown in Table 3.23). They must be specified in the parameter
		dictionary if the <b>SubFileDecode</b> filter is used as one of the
		filters in a <b>ReusableStreamDecode</b> filter (described in the next
		section).
	</p>

			<th>Key</th>

		<tr id="EODCount">
			<th>EODCount</th>

			<td><i>(Required)</i> The number of occurrences of EODString
				that will be passed through the filter and made available for
				reading.</td>

	</table>
	<p>
		<i>EODCount</i> must be a nonnegative integer. If it is greater than
		0, all input data up to and including that many occurrences of <i>EODString</i>
		will be passed through the filter and made available for reading. If <i>EODCount</i>
		is 0, the first occurrence of <i>EODString</i> will be consumed by the
		filter, but it will not be passed through the filter.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>EODString</i> is ordinarily a string of nonzero length. It is
		compared with successive subsequences of the data read from the data
		source. This comparison is based on equality of 8-bit character codes,
		so matching is case-sensitive. Each occurrence of <i>EODString</i> in
		the data is counted once. Overlapping instances of <i>EODString</i>
		will not be recognized. For example, an <i>EODString</i> of eee will
		be recognized only once in the input XeeeeX.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>EODString</i> may also be of length 0, in which case the <b>SubFileDecode</b>
		filter will simply pass <i>EODCount</i> bytes of arbitrary data. This
		is dependable only for binary data, when suitable precautions have
		been taken to protect the data from any modification by communication
		channels or operating systems. Ordinary ASCII text is subject to
		modifications such as translation between different end-of-line
		conventions, which can change the byte count in unpredictable ways.
	</p>
	<p>
		A recommended value for <i>EODString</i> is a document structuring
		comment, such as %%EndBinary. Including newline characters in <i>EODString</i>
		is <i>not</i> recommended; translating the data between different
		end-of-line conventions could subvert the string comparisons.
	</p>
	<p>
		If <i>EODCount</i> is 0 and <i>EODString</i> is of length 0, detection
		of EOD markers is disabled; the filter will not reach EOD. This is
		useful primarily when using procedures or strings as data sources. <i>EODCount</i>
		is not allowed to be negative.
