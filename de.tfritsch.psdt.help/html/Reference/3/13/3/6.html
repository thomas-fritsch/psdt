	<p>
		The <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b> filter decodes image data that has been
		encoded according to the CCITT facsimile standard. See the description
		of the <b>CCITTFaxEncode</b> filter for details of the filter
		parameters.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b> filter encounters improperly encoded
		source data, it will issue an <a href="../../../8/2/i/ioerror.html">ioerror</a>.
		It will not perform any error correction or resynchronization, except
		as noted for <b>DamagedRowsBeforeError</b> in Table 3.21.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>CCITTFaxEncode</b> filter encodes image data according to the
		CCITT facsimile (fax) standard. This encoding is defined by an
		international standards organization, the International
		Telecommunication Union (ITU), formerly known as the Comit&eacute;
		Consultatif International T&eacute;l&eacute;phonique et
		T&eacute;l&eacute;graphique (International Coordinating Committee for
		Telephony and Telegraphy). The encoding is designed to achieve
		efficient compression of monochrome (1 bit per pixel) image data at
		relatively low resolutions. The encoding algorithm is not described in
		this book, but rather in the ITU standard (see the Bibliography). We
		refer to that standard as the CCITT standard for historical reasons.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> PostScript language support for the CCITT standard
			is limited to encoding and decoding of image data. It does not
			include initial connection and handshaking protocols that would be
			required to communicate with a fax machine. The purpose of these
			filters is to enable efficient interchange of bilevel sampled images
			between an application program and a PostScript interpreter.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b> and <b>CCITTFaxEncode</b> filters support
		two encoding schemes, Group 3 and Group 4, and various optional
		features of the CCITT standard. Table 3.21 describes the contents of
		the parameter dictionary for these filters.

		<tr id="Uncompressed">
			<th>Uncompressed</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A flag indicating whether the <b>CCITTFaxEncode</b>
				filter is permitted to use uncompressed encoding when advantageous.
				Uncompressed encoding is an optional part of the CCITT fax encoding
				standard. Its use can prevent significant data expansion when
				encoding certain image data, but many fax machine manufacturers and
				software vendors do not support it. The <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b> filter
				always accepts uncompressed encoding. Default value: <i>false</i>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="K">
			<th>K</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> An integer that selects the encoding
				scheme to be used:
				<dl>
					<dt>&lt; 0</dt>
					<dd>Pure two-dimensional encoding (Group 4)</dd>
					<dt>0</dt>
					<dd>Pure one-dimensional encoding (Group 3, 1-D)</dd>
					<dt>&gt; 0</dt>
					<dd>
						Mixed one- and two-dimensional encoding (Group 3, 2-D), in which a
						line encoded one-dimensionally can be followed by at most <b>K</b>
						- 1 lines encoded two-dimensionally
					</dd>
				</dl> The <b>CCITTFaxEncode</b> filter uses the value of <b>K</b> to
				determine how to encode the data. The <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b> filter
				distinguishes among negative, zero, and positive values of <b>K</b>
				to determine how to interpret the encoded data; however, it does not
				distinguish between different positive <b>K</b> values. Default
				value: 0.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="EndOfLine">
			<th>EndOfLine</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A flag indicating whether the <b>CCITTFaxEncode</b>
				filter prefixes an end-of-line bit pattern to each line of encoded
				data. The <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b> filter always accepts end-of-line
				bit patterns, but requires them to be present only if <b>EndOfLine</b>
				is <i>true</i>. Default value: <i>false</i>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="EncodedByteAlign">
			<th>EncodedByteAlign</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A flag indicating whether the <b>CCITTFaxEncode</b>
				filter inserts extra 0 bits before each encoded line so that the
				line begins on a byte boundary. If <i>true</i>, the <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b>
				filter skips over encoded bits to begin decoding each line at a byte
				boundary. If <i>false</i>, the filters neither generate nor expect
				extra bits in the encoded representation. Default value: <i>false</i>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="Columns">
			<th>Columns</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> The width of the image in pixels. If <b>Columns</b>
				is not a multiple of 8, the filters adjust the width of the
				unencoded image to the next multiple of 8. This adjustment is
				necessary for consistency with the <a
				href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator, which requires
				that each line of source data start on a byte boundary. Default
				value: 1728.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="Rows">
			<th>Rows</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Optional; <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b> only)
			</i> The height of the image in scan lines. If <b>Rows</b> is 0 or
				absent, the image's height is not predetermined; the encoded data
				must be terminated by an end-of-block bit pattern or by the end of
				the filter's data source. Default value: 0.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="EndOfBlock">
			<th>EndOfBlock</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A flag indicating whether the <b>CCITTFaxEncode</b>
				filter appends an end-of-block pattern to the encoded data. If <i>true</i>,
				the <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b> filter expects the encoded data to be
				terminated by end-of-block, overriding the <b>Rows</b> parameter. If
				<i>false</i>, the <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b> filter stops when it has
				decoded the number of lines indicated by <b>Rows</b> or when its
				data source is exhausted, whichever happens first. Default value: <i>true</i>.<br />
				The end-of-block pattern is the CCITT end-of-facsimile-block (EOFB)
				or return-to-control (RTC) appropriate for the <b>K</b> parameter.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="BlackIs1">
			<th>BlackIs1</th>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td><i>(Optional)</i> A flag indicating whether 1 bits are to be
				interpreted as black pixels and 0 bits as white pixels, the reverse
				of the normal Post- Script language convention for image data.
				Default value: <i>false</i>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="DamagedRowsBeforeError">
			<th>DamagedRowsBeforeError</th>
			<td>integer</td>
			<td><i>(Optional; <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b> only)
			</i> The number of damaged rows of data to be tolerated before an <a
				href="../../../8/2/i/ioerror.html">ioerror</a> is generated; applies
				only if <b>EndOfLine</b> is <i>true</i> and <b>K</b> is nonnegative.
				Tolerating a damaged row means locating its end in the encoded data
				by searching for an <b>EndOfLine</b> pattern, then substituting
				decoded data from the previous row if the previous row was not
				damaged, or a white scan line if the previous row was also damaged.
				Default value: 0.</td>

			<th>CloseSource</th>

			<th>CloseTarget</th>
			<td>boolean</td>

	<p>
		The CCITT fax standard specifies a bilevel picture encoding in terms
		of black and white pixels. It does not define a representation for the
		unencoded image data in terms of 0 and 1 bits in memory. However, the
		PostScript language (specifically, the <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator) does impose a
		convention: normally, 0 means black and 1 means white. Therefore, the
		<b>CCITTFaxEncode</b> filter normally encodes 0 bits as black pixels
		and 1 bits as white pixels. Similarly, the <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b>
		filter normally produces 0 bits for black pixels and 1 bits for white
		pixels. The <b>BlackIs1</b> parameter can be used to reverse this
		convention if necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
		The fax encoding method is bit-oriented, not byte-oriented. This means
		that, in principle, encoded or decoded data might not end at a byte
		boundary. The <b>CCITTFaxEncode</b> and <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b> filters
		deal with this problem in the following ways:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Unencoded data is treated as complete scan lines, with unused
			bits inserted at the end of each scan line to fill out the last byte.
			This is compatible with the convention the <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/image.html">image</a> operator uses.
		</li>
		<li>Encoded data is ordinarily treated as a continuous, unbroken
			bit stream. The <b>EncodedByteAlign</b> parameter can be used to
			cause each encoded scan line to be filled to a byte boundary; this
			method is not prescribed by the CCITT standard, and fax machines
			never do this, but some software packages find it convenient to
			encode data this way.
		</li>
		<li>When a filter reaches EOD, it always skips to the next byte
			boundary following the encoded data.</li>
	</ul>
