	<h4>Procedures</h4>
	<p>The data source or target can be a procedure. When the filter
		file is read or written, it calls the procedure to obtain input data
		to be decoded or to dispose of output data that has been encoded. This
		enables the data to be supplied or consumed by an arbitrary program.</p>
	<p>If a procedure is a data source, the filter calls it whenever it
		needs to obtain input data. The procedure must return on the operand
		stack a readable string containing any number of bytes of data. The
		filter pops this string from the stack and uses its contents as input
		to the filter. This process repeats until the filter encounters
		end-of-data (EOD). Any leftover data in the final string is discarded.
		The procedure can return a string of length 0 to indicate that no more
		data is available.</p>
	<p>If a procedure is a data target, the filter calls it whenever it
		needs to dispose of output data. Before calling the procedure, it
		pushes two operands on the stack: a string and a boolean flag. It
		expects the procedure to consume these operands and return a string.
		The filter calls the procedure in the following three situations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On the first write to the filter after the <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a> operator creates it, the
			filter calls the data target procedure with an empty string and the
			boolean value <i>true</i>. The procedure must return a writeable
			string of nonzero length, into which the filter can write filtered
			data.
		</li>
		<li>Whenever the filter needs to dispose of accumulated output
			data, it calls the procedure again, passing it a string containing
			the data and the boolean value <i>true</i>. This string is either the
			same string that was returned from the previous call or a substring
			of that string. The procedure must now do whatever is appropriate
			with the data, then return either the same string or another string
			into which the filter can write additional filtered data.
		</li>
		<li>When the filter file is closed, it calls the procedure a
			final time, passing it a string or substring containing the remaining
			output data, if any, and the boolean value <i>false</i>. The
			procedure must now do whatever is appropriate with the data and
			perform any required end-of-data actions, then return a string. Any
			string (including one of length 0) is acceptable. The filter does not
			use this string, but merely pops it off the stack.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is normal for the data source or target procedure to return
		the same string each time. The string is allocated once at the
		beginning and serves simply as a buffer that is used repeatedly. Each
		time a data source procedure is called, it fills the string with one
		buffer's worth of data and returns it. Similarly, each time a data
		target procedure is called, it first disposes of any buffered data
		passed to it, then returns the original string for reuse.</p>
	<p>
		Between successive calls to the data source or target procedure, a
		program should not do anything that would alter the contents of the
		string returned by that procedure. The filter reads or writes the
		string at unpredictable times, so altering it could disrupt the
		operation of the filter. If the string returned by the procedure is
		reclaimed by a <a href="../../../8/2/r/restore.html">restore</a>
		operation before the filter becomes closed, the results are
		unpredictable. Typically, an <a href="../../../8/2/i/ioerror.html">ioerror</a>
		occurs.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> If a filter file object is reclaimed by <a
			href="../../../8/2/r/restore.html">restore</a> or garbage collection
			before being closed, it is closed automatically; however, the data
			target procedure is not called. </i>
	</p>
	<p>One use of procedures as data sources or targets is to run
		filters "backward." Filters are organized so that decoding filters are
		input files and encoding filters are output files. Normally, a
		PostScript program obtains encoded data from some external source,
		decodes it, and uses the decoded data; or it generates some data,
		encodes it, and sends it to some external destination. The
		organization of filters supports this model. However, if a program
		must provide the input to a decoding filter or consume the output of
		an encoding filter, it can do so by using procedures as data sources
		or targets.</p>
