	<h4>Strings</h4>
	<p>If a string is a data source, the filter simply uses its
		contents as data to be decoded. If the filter encounters EOD, it
		ignores the remainder of the string. Otherwise, it continues until it
		has exhausted the string data. Until the filter is closed, the string
		should be treated as read-only. Writing into such a string will have
		unpredictable consequences for the data read from the filter.</p>
	<p>
		If a string is a data target, the filter writes encoded data into it.
		This continues until the filter is closed. The contents of the string
		are not dependable until that time. If the filter exhausts the
		capacity of the string, an <a href="../../../8/2/i/ioerror.html">ioerror</a>
		occurs. There is no way to determine how much data the filter has
		written into the string; if a program needs to know, it should use a
		procedure as the data target.
