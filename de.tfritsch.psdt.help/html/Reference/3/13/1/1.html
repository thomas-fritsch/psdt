	<h4>Files</h4>
	<p>
		A file is the most common data source or target for a filter. A file
		used as a data source must be an input file, and one used as a data
		target must be an output file; otherwise, an <a
			href="../../../8/2/i/invalidaccess.html">invalidaccess</a> error
		occurs.
	</p>
	<p>If a file is a data source for a decoding filter, the filter
		reads from it as necessary to satisfy demands on the filter, until
		either the filter reaches its end-of-data (EOD) condition or the data
		source reaches end-of-file. If a file is a data target for an encoding
		filter, the filter writes to it as necessary to dispose of data that
		has been written to the filter and transformed.</p>
	<p>
		Closing a filter file does not close the underlying file, unless
		explicitly directed by the <b>CloseSource</b> or <b>CloseTarget</b>
		filter parameter <i>(LanguageLevel 3)</i>. A program typically creates
		a decoding filter to process data embedded in the program file
		itself&mdash; the one designated by <a
			href="../../../8/2/c/currentfile.html">currentfile</a>. When the
		filter reaches EOD, execution of the underlying file resumes.
		Similarly, a program can embed the output of an encoding filter in the
		middle of an arbitrary data stream being written to the underlying
		output file.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once a program has begun reading from or writing to a filter, it
		should not attempt to access the underlying file in any way until the
		filter has been closed. Doing so could interfere with the operation of
		the filter and leave the underlying file in an unpredictable state.
		However, it is safe to access the underlying file after execution of <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a> but before the first
		read or write of the filter file, except in certain uses of the <b>ReusableStreamDecode</b>
		filter. The method for establishing a filter pipeline in Example 3.5
		on page 84 depends on this.
