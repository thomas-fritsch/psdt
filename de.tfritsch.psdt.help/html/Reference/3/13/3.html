	<h2>3.13.3 Details of Individual Filters</h2>
	<p>
		As stated in Section <a href="../8/4.html">3.8.4, "Filters,"</a> the
		PostScript language supports three categories of standard filters:
		ASCII encoding and decoding filters, compression and decompression
		filters, and subfile filters. The following sections document the
		individual filters.
	</p>
	<p>Some of the encoded formats these filters support are the same
		as or similar to those supported by applications or utility programs
		on many computer systems. It should be straightforward to make those
		programs compatible with the filters. Also, C language implementations
		of some filters are available from the Adobe Developers Association.</p>
