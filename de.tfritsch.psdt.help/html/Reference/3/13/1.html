	<h2>3.13.1 Data Sources and Targets</h2>
	<p>
		As stated in Section <a href="../8/4.html">3.8.4, "Filters,"</a> there
		are two kinds of filters: decoding filters and encoding filters. A
		decoding filter is an input file that reads from an underlying data
		source and produces transformed data as it is read. An encoding filter
		is an output file that takes the data written to it and writes
		transformed data to an underlying data target. Data sources and data
		targets may be files, procedures, or strings.
