	<h2>3.13 Filtered Files Details</h2>
	<p>
		LanguageLevels 2 and 3 define a special kind of file called a filter,
		which reads or writes an underlying file and transforms the data in
		some way. Filters are introduced in Section <a href="8/4.html">3.8.4,
			"Filters."</a> This section describes the semantics of filters in more
		detail. It includes information about:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The use of files, procedures, and strings as data sources and
			targets</li>
		<li>End-of-data conventions</li>
		<li>Details of individual filters</li>
		<li>Specifications of encoding algorithms for some filters</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All features described in this section are LanguageLevel 2
		features except for those labeled as LanguageLevel 3.</p>
