	<h2>3.11.1 Error Initiation</h2>
	<p>When an error occurs, the interpreter does the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Restores the operand stack to the state it was in when it
			began executing the current object.</li>
		<li>Pushes that object on the operand stack.</li>
		<li>Looks up the error's name in <b>errordict</b> and executes
			the associated value, which is the <em>error handler</em> for that
			error.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		This is everything the interpreter itself does in response to an
		error. The error handler in <b>errordict</b> is responsible for all
		other actions. A PostScript program can modify error behavior by
		defining its own error-handling procedures and associating them with
		the names in <b>errordict</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>interrupt</b> and <b>timeout</b> errors, which are initiated by
		events external to the PostScript interpreter, are treated specially.
		The interpreter merely executes <b>interrupt</b> or <b>timeout</b>
		from <b>errordict</b>, sandwiched between execution of two objects
		being interpreted in normal sequence. It does not push the object
		being executed, nor does it alter the operand stack in any other way.
		In other words, it omits steps 1 and 2 above.
