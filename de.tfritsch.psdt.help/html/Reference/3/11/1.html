	<h2>3.11.1 Error Initiation</h2>
	<p>When an error occurs, the interpreter does the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Restores the operand stack to the state it was in when it
			began executing the current object.</li>
		<li>Pushes that object on the operand stack.</li>
		<li>Looks up the error's name in <a
			href="../../8/2/e/errordict.html">errordict</a> and executes the
			associated value, which is the <em>error handler</em> for that error.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		This is everything the interpreter itself does in response to an
		error. The error handler in <a href="../../8/2/e/errordict.html">errordict</a>
		is responsible for all other actions. A PostScript program can modify
		error behavior by defining its own error-handling procedures and
		associating them with the names in <a
			href="../../8/2/e/errordict.html">errordict</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/i/interrupt.html">interrupt</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/t/timeout.html">timeout</a> errors, which are
		initiated by events external to the PostScript interpreter, are
		treated specially. The interpreter merely executes <a
			href="../../8/2/i/interrupt.html">interrupt</a> or <a
			href="../../8/2/t/timeout.html">timeout</a> from <a
			href="../../8/2/e/errordict.html">errordict</a>, sandwiched between
		execution of two objects being interpreted in normal sequence. It does
		not push the object being executed, nor does it alter the operand
		stack in any other way. In other words, it omits steps 1 and 2 above.
