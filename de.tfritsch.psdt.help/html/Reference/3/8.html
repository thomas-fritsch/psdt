	<h2>3.8 File Input and Output</h2>
	<p>
		A <i>file</i> is a finite sequence of characters bounded by an
		end-of-file indication. These characters may be stored permanently in
		some place (for instance, a disk file) or they may be generated on the
		fly and transmitted over some communication channel. Files are the
		means by which the PostScript interpreter receives executable programs
		and exchanges data with the external environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two kinds of file: input and output. An <i>input file</i> is
		a source from which a PostScript program can read a sequence of
		characters; an <i>output file</i> is a destination to which a
		PostScript program can write characters. Some files can be both read
		and written.
	</p>
	<p>The contents of a file are treated as a sequence of 8-bit bytes.
		In some cases, those bytes can be interpreted as text characters, such
		as the ASCII text representing a PostScript program. In other cases,
		they can be interpreted as arbitrary binary data. In the descriptions
		of files and file operators, the terms character and byte are
		synonymous.</p>
