	<h2>3.11 Errors</h2>
	<p>Various sorts of errors can occur during execution of a
		PostScript program. Some errors are detected by the PostScript
		interpreter, such as overflow of one of the interpreterâ€™s stacks.
		Others are detected during execution of the built-in operators, such
		as occurrence of the wrong type of operand.</p>
	<p>
		Errors are handled in a uniform fashion that is under the control of
		the PostScript program. Each error is associated with a name, such as
		<b>stackoverflow</b> or <b>typecheck</b>. Each error name appears as a
		key in a special dictionary called <b>errordict</b> and is associated
		with a value that is the handler for that error. The complete set of
		error names appears in Section 8.1, "Operator Summary."
