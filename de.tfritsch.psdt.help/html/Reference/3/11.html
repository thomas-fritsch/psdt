	<h2>3.11 Errors</h2>
	<p>Various sorts of errors can occur during execution of a
		PostScript program. Some errors are detected by the PostScript
		interpreter, such as overflow of one of the interpreterâ€™s stacks.
		Others are detected during execution of the built-in operators, such
		as occurrence of the wrong type of operand.</p>
	<p>
		Errors are handled in a uniform fashion that is under the control of
		the PostScript program. Each error is associated with a name, such as
		<a href="../8/2/s/stackoverflow.htnl">stackoverflow</a> or <a
			href="../8/2/t/typecheck.html">typecheck</a>. Each error name appears
		as a key in a special dictionary called <a
			href="../8/2/e/errordict.html">errordict</a> and is associated with a
		value that is the handler for that error. The complete set of error
		names appears in Section <a href="../8/1/24.html">8.1, "Operator
			Summary."</a>
