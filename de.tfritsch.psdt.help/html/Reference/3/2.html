	<h2>3.2 Syntax</h2>
	<p>
		As the interpreter scans the text of a PostScript program, it creates
		various types of PostScript objects, such as numbers, strings, and
		procedures. This section discusses only the <em>syntactic</em>
		representation of such objects. Their internal representation and
		behavior are covered in Section 3.3, "Data Types and Objects."
	</p>
	<p>
		There are three encodings for the PostScript language: <em>ASCII</em>,
		<em>binary token</em>, and <em>binary object sequence</em>. The ASCII
		encoding is preferred for expository purposes (such as this book), for
		archiving documents, and for transmission via communications
		facilities, because it is easy to read and does not rely on any
		special characters that might be reserved for communications use. The
		two binary encodings are usable in controlled environments to improve
		the efficiency of representation or execution; they are intended
		exclusively for machine generation. Detailed information on the binary
		encodings is provided in Section 3.14, "Binary Encoding Details."
