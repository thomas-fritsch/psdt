	<h2>3.3 Data Types and Objects</h2>
	<p>
		All data accessible to PostScript programs, including procedures that
		are part of the programs themselves, exists in the form of <i>objects</i>.
		Objects are produced, manipulated, and consumed by the PostScript
		operators. They are also created by the scanner and executed by the
		interpreter.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each object has a <i>type</i>, some <i>attributes</i>, and a <i>value</i>.
		Objects contain their own dynamic types; that is, an object's type is
		a property of the object itself, not of where it is stored or what it
		is called. Table 3.2 lists all the object types supported by the
		PostScript language. Extensions to the language may introduce
		additional object types. The distinction between simple and composite
		objects is explained below.
	</p>
