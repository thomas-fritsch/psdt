	<h4>Category Implementation Dictionary</h4>
	<p>
		The behavior of all the resource operators, such as <a
			href="../../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>, is
		determined by entries in the resource category's implementation
		dictionary. This dictionary was supplied as an operand to <a
			href="../../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a> when the
		category was created. In the example
	</p>
	<pre>/Frob1 w /Widget defineresource</pre>
	<p>
		the <b>defineresource</b> operator does the following:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Obtains catdict, the implementation dictionary for the <b>Widget</b>
			category
		</li>
		<li>Executes <a href="../../../8/2/b/begin.html">begin</a> on the
			implementation dictionary.
		</li>
		<li>Executes the dictionary's <b>DefineResource</b> entry, which
			is ordinarily a procedure but might be an operator. When the
			procedure corresponding to the <b>DefineResource</b> entry is called,
			the operand stack contains the operands that were passed to <a
			href="../../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>, except
			that the category name (Widget in this example) has been removed. <b>DefineResource</b>
			is expected to consume the remaining operands, perform whatever
			action is appropriate for this resource category, and return the
			appropriate result.
		</li>
		<li>Executes the <a href="../../../8/2/e/end.html">end</a> operator.
			If an error occurred during step 3, it also restores the operand and
			dictionary stacks to their initial state.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The other resource operators&mdash;<a
			href="../../../8/2/u/undefineresource.html">undefineresource</a>, <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a>, <a
			href="../../../8/2/r/resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a>, and <a
			href="../../../8/2/r/resourceforall.html">resourceforall</a>&mdash;behave
		the same way, with the exception that <a
			href="../../../8/2/r/resourceforall.html">resourceforall</a> does not
		restore the stacks upon error. Aside from the steps described above,
		all of the behavior of the resource operators is implemented by the
		corresponding procedures in the dictionary.
	</p>
	<p>A category implementation dictionary contains the entries listed
		in Table 3.11. The dictionary may also contain other information
		useful to the procedures in the dictionary. Since the dictionary is on
		the dictionary stack at the time those procedures are called, the
		procedures can access the information conveniently.</p>

				should put that dictionary back on the dictionary stack before

	<p>
		A single dictionary provides the implementation for both local and
		global instances of a category. The implementation must maintain the
		local and global instances separately and must respect the VM
		allocation mode in effect at the time each resource operator is
		executed. The category implementation dictionary must be in global VM;
		the <a href="../../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>
		operator that installs it in the <b>Category</b> category must be
		executed while in global VM allocation mode.
	</p>
	<p>
		The interpreter assumes that the category implementation procedures
		will be reasonably well behaved and will generate errors only due to
		circumstances not under their control. In this respect, they are
		similar to the <b>BuildChar</b> procedure in a Type 3 font or to the <b>PaintProc</b>
		procedure in a form or pattern, but are unlike the arbitrary
		procedures invoked by operators such as <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/forall.html">forall</a> or <a
			href="../../../8/2/r/resourcesforall.html">resourceforall</a>.
	</p>
	<p>If an error occurs in a category implementation procedure, the
		resource operator makes a token attempt to restore the stacks and to
		provide the illusion that the error arose from the operator itself.
		The intent is that the resource operators should have the usual error
		behavior as viewed by a program executing them. The purpose is not to
		compensate for bugs in the resource implementation procedures.</p>
