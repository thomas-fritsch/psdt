	<h4>Implicit Resources</h4>
	<p>
		For all implicit resources, the <a
			href="../../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a> operator
		returns the instance's key if the instance is defined. The <a
			href="../../../8/2/r/resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a> and <a
			href="../../../8/2/r/resourceforall.html">resourceforall</a>
		operators have their normal behavior, although the <i>status</i> and <i>size</i>
		values returned by <a href="../../../8/2/r/resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a>
		are meaningless. The <a href="../../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>
		and <a href="../../../8/2/u/undefineresource.html">undefineresource</a>
		operators are ordinarily not allowed, but the ability to define new
		instances of implicit resources may exist in some implementations. The
		mechanisms are implementation-dependent.
	</p>
	<p>
		The instances of the <b>Filter</b> category are filter names, such as
		<b>ASCII85Decode</b> and <b>RunLengthEncode</b>, which are used as an
		operand of the <a href="../../../8/2/f/filter.html">filter</a>
		operator to determine its behavior. Filters are described in Section <a
			href="../../../3/8/4.html">3.8.4, "Filters."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The instances of the <b>ColorSpaceFamily</b> category are color space
		family names, which appear as the first element of a color space array
		object. Some color spaces, such as <b>DeviceRGB</b>, are completely
		determined by their family name; others, such as <b>CIEBasedABC</b>,
		require additional parameters to describe them. Color spaces are
		described in Section <a href="../../../4/8.html">4.8, "Color
			Spaces."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The instances of the <b>Emulator</b> category are names of emulators
		for languages other than PostScript that may be built into a
		particular implementation. Those emulators are not a standard part of
		the PostScript language, but one or more of them may be present in
		some products. This category has been superseded by the <b>PDL</b>
		resource category in LanguageLevel 3.
	</p>
	<p>
		The instances of the <b>IODevice</b> category are names of device
		parameter sets. Some parameter sets are associated with input/output
		devices, from which the category name <b>IODevice</b> originates.
		However, there are also some parameter sets that do not correspond to
		physical devices. The keys for all instances of this category are
		expressed as strings of the form %device%. See Section <a
			href="../../../C/4.html">C.4, "Device Parameters."</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The instances of the <b>ColorRenderingType</b>, <b>FMapType</b>, <b>FontType</b>,
		<b>FormType</b>, <b>HalftoneType</b>, <b>ImageType</b>, <b>PatternType</b>,
		<b>FunctionType</b>, <b>ShadingType</b>, and <b>TrappingType</b>
		categories are integers that are the acceptable values for the
		correspondingly named entries in various classes of special
		dictionaries. For example, in LanguageLevel 3 the <b>FMapType</b>
		category includes the integers 1 through 9 as keys; if an interpreter
		supports additional FMapType values, the <b>FMapType</b> category will
		also include those values as instances.
