	<h4>ProcSet</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>ProcSet</b> resource category are procedure sets.
		A procedure set is a dictionary containing named procedures or
		operators. Application prologs can be organized as one or more
		procedure sets that are available from a library instead of being
		included in-line in every document that uses them. The <b>ProcSet</b>
		resource category provides a way to organize such a library.
	</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 3, there are several standard instances of the <b>ProcSet</b>
		category that are associated with specific features of the PostScript
		language. These procedure sets, listed in Table 3.10, contain
		procedures, operators, and other objects that a PostScript program can
		access as part of using those features.
