	<h4>ControlLanguage, PDL, Localization, and HWOptions</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the LanguageLevel 3 resource categories <b>ControlLanguage</b>,
		<b>PDL</b>, <b>Localization</b>, and <b>HWOptions</b> provide
		information that is product-dependent, as summarized below. For
		further details, see the <a

			Language Reference Supplement</a>.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Instances of <b>ControlLanguage</b> are dictionaries that
			describe the control languages available in a product. A control
			language is a means for controlling product features, such as default
			configuration and status reporting.
		</li>
		<li>Instances of <b>PDL</b> are dictionaries that describe the
			page description language interpreters available in a product. This
			category supersedes the <b>Emulator</b> implicit resource category,
			because its instances provide a more complete description of each
			interpreter (or emulator).
		</li>
		<li>Instances of <b>Localization</b> are dictionaries that
			describe the natural languages (for example, English, Japanese, or
			German) supported by a product.
		</li>
		<li>Instances of <b>HWOptions</b> are strings that indicate the
			special hardware options that are present in this product.
		</li>
