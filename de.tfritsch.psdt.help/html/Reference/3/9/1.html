	<h3>3.9.1 Resource Operators</h3>
	<p>
		There are five LanguageLevel 2 operators that apply to resources: <a
			href="../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/resourceforall.html">resourceforall</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/u/undefineresource.html">undefineresource</a>. A more
		limited pair of operators applicable only to fonts, <a
			href="../../8/2/f/findfont.html">findfont</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/d/definefont.html">definefont</a>, are available in
		LanguageLevel 1.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a> operator
		is the key feature of the resource facility. Given a resource category
		name and an instance name, <a href="../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a>
		returns an object. If the requested resource instance does not already
		exist as an object in VM, <a href="../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a>
		gets it from an external source and loads it into VM. A PostScript
		program can access named resources without knowing whether they are
		already in VM or how they are obtained from external storage.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other important features include <a
			href="../../8/2/r/resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a>, which
		returns information about a resource instance, and <a
			href="../../8/2/r/resourceforall.html">resourceforall</a>, which
		enumerates all available resource instances in a particular category.
		These operators apply to all resource instances, whether or not they
		reside in VM; the operators do not cause the resource instances to be
		brought into VM. <a href="../../8/2/r/resourceforall.html">resourceforall</a>
		should be used with care and only when absolutely necessary, since the
		set of available resource instances is potentially extremely large.
	</p>
	<p>
		A program can explicitly define a named resource instance in VM. That
		is, it can create an object in VM, then execute <a
			href="../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a> to
		associate the object with a name in a particular resource category.
		This resource instance will be visible in subsequent executions of <a
			href="../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/r/resourceforall.html">resourceforall</a>. A program
		can also execute <a href="../../8/2/u/undefineresource.html">undefineresource</a>
		to reverse the effect of a prior <a
			href="../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>. The <a
			href="../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a> operator
		automatically executes <a href="../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>
		and <a href="../../8/2/u/undefineresource.html">undefineresource</a>
		to manage VM for resource instances that it obtains from external
		storage.
	</p>
	<p>
		Resource instances can be defined in either local or global VM. The
		lifetime of the definition depends on the VM allocation mode in effect
		at the time the definition is made (see Section <a href="../7/2.html">3.7.2,
			"Local and Global VM"</a>). Normally, both local and global resource
		instances are visible and available to a program. However, when the
		current VM allocation mode is global, only global instances are
		visible; this ensures correct behavior of resource instances that are
		defined in terms of other resource instances.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a program executes <a href="../../f/findresource.html">findresource</a>
		to define a resource instance explicitly, the program has complete
		control over whether to use local or global VM. However, when
		execution of <a href="../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a>
		causes a resource instance to be brought into VM automatically, the
		decision whether to use local or global VM is independent of the VM
		allocation mode at the time <a href="../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a>
		is executed. Usually, resource instances are loaded into global VM;
		this enables them to be managed independently of the save and restore
		activity of the executing program. However, certain resource instances
		do not function correctly when they reside in global VM; they are
		loaded into local VM instead. In general, PostScript programs using
		resources should not depend on knowing anything about the policies
		used by the resource machinery, since those policies can vary among
		different resource implementations.
	</p>
	<p>The language does not specify a standard method for installing
		resources in external storage. Installation typically consists of
		writing to a named file in a file system. However, details of how
		resource names are mapped to file names and how the files are managed
		are environment-dependent. In some environments, resources may be
		installed using facilities entirely separate from the PostScript
		interpreter.</p>
	<p>
		Resource instances are identified by keys that ordinarily are name or
		string objects; the resource operators treat names and strings
		equivalently. Use of other types of keys is permitted but not
		recommended. The <a href="../../d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>
		operator can define a resource instance with a key that is not a name
		or a string, and the other resource operators can access the instance
		using that key. However, such a key can never match any resource
		instance in external storage.
