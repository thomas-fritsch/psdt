	<h3>3.9.1 Resource Operators</h3>
	<p>
		There are five LanguageLevel 2 operators that apply to resources: <b>findresource</b>,
		<b>resourcestatus</b>, <b>resourceforall</b>, <b>defineresource</b>,
		and <b>undefineresource</b>. A more limited pair of operators
		applicable only to fonts, <b>findfont</b> and <b>definefont</b>, are
		available in LanguageLevel 1.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>findresource</b> operator is the key feature of the resource
		facility. Given a resource category name and an instance name, <b>findresource</b>
		returns an object. If the requested resource instance does not already
		exist as an object in VM, <b>findresource</b> gets it from an external
		source and loads it into VM. A PostScript program can access named
		resources without knowing whether they are already in VM or how they
		are obtained from external storage.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other important features include <b>resourcestatus</b>, which returns
		information about a resource instance, and <b>resourceforall</b>,
		which enumerates all available resource instances in a particular
		category. These operators apply to all resource instances, whether or
		not they reside in VM; the operators do not cause the resource
		instances to be brought into VM. <b>resourceforall</b> should be used
		with care and only when absolutely necessary, since the set of
		available resource instances is potentially extremely large.
	</p>
	<p>
		A program can explicitly define a named resource instance in VM. That
		is, it can create an object in VM, then execute <b>defineresource</b>
		to associate the object with a name in a particular resource category.
		This resource instance will be visible in subsequent executions of <b>findresource</b>,
		<b>resourcestatus</b>, and <b>resourceforall</b>. A program can also
		execute <b>undefineresource</b> to reverse the effect of a prior <b>defineresource</b>.
		The <b>findresource</b> operator automatically executes <b>defineresource</b>
		and <b>undefineresource</b> to manage VM for resource instances that
		it obtains from external storage.
	</p>
	<p>Resource instances can be defined in either local or global VM.
		The lifetime of the definition depends on the VM allocation mode in
		effect at the time the definition is made (see Section 3.7.2, "Local
		and Global VM"). Normally, both local and global resource instances
		are visible and available to a program. However, when the current VM
		allocation mode is global, only global instances are visible; this
		ensures correct behavior of resource instances that are defined in
		terms of other resource instances.</p>
	<p>
		When a program executes <b>defineresource</b> to define a resource
		instance explicitly, the program has complete control over whether to
		use local or global VM. However, when execution of <b>findresource</b>
		causes a resource instance to be brought into VM automatically, the
		decision whether to use local or global VM is independent of the VM
		allocation mode at the time <b>findresource</b> is executed. Usually,
		resource instances are loaded into global VM; this enables them to be
		managed independently of the save and restore activity of the
		executing program. However, certain resource instances do not function
		correctly when they reside in global VM; they are loaded into local VM
		instead. In general, PostScript programs using resources should not
		depend on knowing anything about the policies used by the resource
		machinery, since those policies can vary among different resource
		implementations.
	</p>
	<p>The language does not specify a standard method for installing
		resources in external storage. Installation typically consists of
		writing to a named file in a file system. However, details of how
		resource names are mapped to file names and how the files are managed
		are environment-dependent. In some environments, resources may be
		installed using facilities entirely separate from the PostScript
		interpreter.</p>
	<p>
		Resource instances are identified by keys that ordinarily are name or
		string objects; the resource operators treat names and strings
		equivalently. Use of other types of keys is permitted but not
		recommended. The <b>defineresource</b> operator can define a resource
		instance with a key that is not a name or a string, and the other
		resource operators can access the instance using that key. However,
		such a key can never match any resource instance in external storage.
