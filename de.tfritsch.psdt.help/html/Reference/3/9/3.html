<title>Creating Resource Categories</title>

	<h3>3.9.3 Creating Resource Categories</h3>
	<p>The language support for named resources is quite general. Most
		of it is independent of the semantics of specific resource categories.
		It is occasionally useful to create new resource categories, each
		containing an independent collection of named instances. This is
		accomplished through a level of recursion in the resource machinery
		itself.</p>
	<p>
		The resource category named <b>Category</b> contains all of the
		resource categories as instances. The instance names are resource
		category names, such as <b>Font</b>, <b>Form</b>, and <b>Halftone</b>.
		The instance values are dictionary objects containing information
		about how the corresponding resource category is implemented.
	</p>
	<p>
		A new resource category is created by defining a new instance of the <b>Category</b>
		category. Example 3.6 creates a category named <b>Widget</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 3.6</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
    true setglobal
      /Widget catdict /Category defineresource pop
    false setglobal
	</pre>
	<p>In this example, catdict is a dictionary describing the
		implementation of the Widget category. Once it is defined, instances
		of the Widget category can be manipulated like other categories:</p>
	<pre>
    /Frob1 w /Widget defineresource          % Returns w
    /Frob1 /Widget findresource              % Returns w
    /Frob1 /Widget resourcestatus            % Returns status size true
    (*) proc scratch /Widget resourceforall  % Pushes (Frob1) on the stack, then calls proc
    </pre>
	<p>Here w is an instance of the Widget category whose type is
		whatever is appropriate for widgets, and /Frob1 is the name of that
		instance.</p>
	<p>It is possible to redefine existing resource categories in this
		way. Programs that do this must ensure that the new definition
		correctly implements any special semantics of the category.</p>
	<h4>Category Implementation Dictionary</h4>
	<p>The behavior of all the resource operators, such as
		defineresource, is determined by entries in the resource category's
		implementation dictionary. This dictionary was supplied as an operand
		to defineresource when the category was created. In the example</p>
	<pre>
	/Frob1 w /Widget defineresource</pre>
	<p>
		the <b>defineresource</b> operator does the following:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Obtains catdict, the implementation dictionary for the <b>Widget</b>
			category
		</li>
		<li>Executes <b>begin</b> on the implementation dictionary.
		</li>
		<li>Executes the dictionaryâ€™s <b>DefineResource</b> entry, which
			is ordinarily a procedure but might be an operator. When the
			procedure corresponding to the <b>DefineResource</b> entry is called,
			the operand stack contains the operands that were passed to <b>defineresource</b>,
			except that the category name (Widget in this example) has been
			removed. <b>DefineResource</b> is expected to consume the remaining
			operands, perform whatever action is appropriate for this resource
			category, and return the appropriate result.
		</li>
		<li>Executes the <b>end</b> operator. If an error occurred during
			step 3, it also restores the operand and dictionary stacks to their
			initial state.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The other resource operators&mdash;<b>undefineresource</b>, <b>findresource</b>,
		<b>resourcestatus</b>, and <b>resourceforall</b>&mdash;behave the same
		way, with the exception that <b>resourceforall</b> does not restore
		the stacks upon error. Aside from the steps described above, all of
		the behavior of the resource operators is implemented by the
		corresponding procedures in the dictionary.
	</p>
	<p>A category implementation dictionary contains the entries listed
		in Table 3.11. The dictionary may also contain other information
		useful to the procedures in the dictionary. Since the dictionary is on
		the dictionary stack at the time those procedures are called, the
		procedures can access the information conveniently.</p>

	<p>
		A single dictionary provides the implementation for both local and
		global instances of a category. The implementation must maintain the
		local and global instances separately and must respect the VM
		allocation mode in effect at the time each resource operator is
		executed. The category implementation dictionary must be in global VM;
		the <b>defineresource</b> operator that installs it in the <b>Category</b>
		category must be executed while in global VM allocation mode.
	</p>
	<p>
		The interpreter assumes that the category implementation procedures
		will be reasonably well behaved and will generate errors only due to
		circumstances not under their control. In this respect, they are
		similar to the <b>BuildChar</b> procedure in a Type 3 font or to the <b>PaintProc</b>
		procedure in a form or pattern, but are unlike the arbitrary
		procedures invoked by operators such as <b>forall</b> or <b>resourceforall</b>.
	</p>
	<p>If an error occurs in a category implementation procedure, the
		resource operator makes a token attempt to restore the stacks and to
		provide the illusion that the error arose from the operator itself.
		The intent is that the resource operators should have the usual error
		behavior as viewed by a program executing them. The purpose is not to
		compensate for bugs in the resource implementation procedures.</p>
