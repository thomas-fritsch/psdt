	<h3>3.9.3 Creating Resource Categories</h3>
	<p>The language support for named resources is quite general. Most
		of it is independent of the semantics of specific resource categories.
		It is occasionally useful to create new resource categories, each
		containing an independent collection of named instances. This is
		accomplished through a level of recursion in the resource machinery
		itself.</p>
	<p>
		The resource category named <b>Category</b> contains all of the
		resource categories as instances. The instance names are resource
		category names, such as <b>Font</b>, <b>Form</b>, and <b>Halftone</b>.
		The instance values are dictionary objects containing information
		about how the corresponding resource category is implemented.
	</p>
	<p>
		A new resource category is created by defining a new instance of the <b>Category</b>
		category. Example 3.6 creates a category named <b>Widget</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 3.6</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
true setglobal
  /Widget catdict /Category defineresource pop
false setglobal</pre>
	<p>
		In this example, <i>catdict</i> is a dictionary describing the
		implementation of the Widget category. Once it is defined, instances
		of the Widget category can be manipulated like other categories:
	</p>
	<pre>
/Frob1 w /Widget defineresource          % Returns w
/Frob1 /Widget findresource              % Returns w
/Frob1 /Widget resourcestatus            % Returns status size true
(*) proc scratch /Widget resourceforall  % Pushes (Frob1) on the stack, then calls proc</pre>
	<p>Here w is an instance of the Widget category whose type is
		whatever is appropriate for widgets, and /Frob1 is the name of that
		instance.</p>
	<p>It is possible to redefine existing resource categories in this
		way. Programs that do this must ensure that the new definition
		correctly implements any special semantics of the category.</p>

	<h4 id="1">Category Implementation Dictionary</h4>
	<p>
		The behavior of all the resource operators, such as <a
			href="../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>, is
		determined by entries in the resource category's implementation
		dictionary. This dictionary was supplied as an operand to <a
			href="../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a> when the
		category was created. In the example
	</p>
	<pre>/Frob1 w /Widget defineresource</pre>
	<p>
		the <b>defineresource</b> operator does the following:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Obtains catdict, the implementation dictionary for the <b>Widget</b>
			category
		</li>
		<li>Executes <a href="../../8/2/b/begin.html">begin</a> on the
			implementation dictionary.
		</li>
		<li>Executes the dictionary's <b>DefineResource</b> entry, which
			is ordinarily a procedure but might be an operator. When the
			procedure corresponding to the <b>DefineResource</b> entry is called,
			the operand stack contains the operands that were passed to <a
			href="../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>, except
			that the category name (Widget in this example) has been removed. <b>DefineResource</b>
			is expected to consume the remaining operands, perform whatever
			action is appropriate for this resource category, and return the
			appropriate result.
		</li>
		<li>Executes the <a href="../../8/2/e/end.html">end</a> operator.
			If an error occurred during step 3, it also restores the operand and
			dictionary stacks to their initial state.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The other resource operators&mdash;<a
			href="../../8/2/u/undefineresource.html">undefineresource</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/r/resourcestatus.html">resourcestatus</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/r/resourceforall.html">resourceforall</a>&mdash;behave
		the same way, with the exception that <a
			href="../../8/2/r/resourceforall.html">resourceforall</a> does not
		restore the stacks upon error. Aside from the steps described above,
		all of the behavior of the resource operators is implemented by the
		corresponding procedures in the dictionary.
	</p>
	<p>A category implementation dictionary contains the entries listed
		in Table 3.11. The dictionary may also contain other information
		useful to the procedures in the dictionary. Since the dictionary is on
		the dictionary stack at the time those procedures are called, the
		procedures can access the information conveniently.</p>

	<p>
		A single dictionary provides the implementation for both local and
		global instances of a category. The implementation must maintain the
		local and global instances separately and must respect the VM
		allocation mode in effect at the time each resource operator is
		executed. The category implementation dictionary must be in global VM;
		the <a href="../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a>
		operator that installs it in the <b>Category</b> category must be
		executed while in global VM allocation mode.
	</p>
	<p>
		The interpreter assumes that the category implementation procedures
		will be reasonably well behaved and will generate errors only due to
		circumstances not under their control. In this respect, they are
		similar to the <b>BuildChar</b> procedure in a Type 3 font or to the <b>PaintProc</b>
		procedure in a form or pattern, but are unlike the arbitrary
		procedures invoked by operators such as <a
			href="../../8/2/f/forall.html">forall</a> or <a
			href="../../8/2/r/resourcesforall.html">resourceforall</a>.
	</p>
	<p>If an error occurs in a category implementation procedure, the
		resource operator makes a token attempt to restore the stacks and to
		provide the illusion that the error arose from the operator itself.
		The intent is that the resource operators should have the usual error
		behavior as viewed by a program executing them. The purpose is not to
		compensate for bugs in the resource implementation procedures.</p>

	<h4 id="2">Generic Category</h4>
	<p>The preceding section describes a way to define a new resource
		category, but it does not provide guidance about how the individual
		procedures in the category's dictionary should be implemented. In
		principle, every resource category has complete freedom over how to
		organize and manage resource instances, both in VM and in external
		storage.</p>
	<p>
		Since different implementations have different conventions for
		organizing resource instances, especially in external storage, a
		program that seeks to create a new resource category might need
		implementation-dependent information. To overcome this problem, it is
		useful to have a generic resource implementation that can be copied
		and used to define new resource categories. The <b>Category</b>
		category contains an instance named <b>Generic</b>, whose value is a
		dictionary containing a generic resource implementation.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 3.7</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
currentglobal                     % Save the current VM status on the stack.
true setglobal
/Generic /Category findresource
dup length 1 add dict copy
dup /InstanceType /dicttype put
/Widget exch /Category defineresource pop
setglobal                         % Restore the saved VM status.</pre>
	<p>
		The <b>Generic</b> resource category's implementation dictionary does
		not have an <b>InstanceType</b> entry; instances need not be of any
		particular type. The example above makes a copy of the dictionary with
		space for one additional entry and inserts an <b>InstanceType</b>
		entry with the value dicttype. As a result, <a
			href="../../8/2/d/defineresource.html">defineresource</a> requires
		that instances of the Widget category be dictionaries.
