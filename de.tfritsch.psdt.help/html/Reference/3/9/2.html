	<h3>3.9.2 Resource Categories</h3>
	<p>Resource categories are identified by name. Tables 3.7, 3.8, and
		3.9 list the standard resource categories. Within a given category,
		every resource instance that resides in VM is of a particular type and
		has a particular intended interpretation or use.</p>
	<p>
		Regular resources are those whose instances are ordinary useful
		objects, such as font or halftone dictionaries. For example, a program
		typically uses the result returned by <b>findresource</b> as an
		operand of some other operator, such as <b>scalefont</b> or <b>sethalftone</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Implicit resources represent some built-in capability of the
		PostScript interpreter. For example, the instances of the <b>Filter</b>
		category are filter names, such as <b>ASCII85Decode</b> and <b>CCITTFaxDecode</b>,
		that are passed directly to the filter operator. For such resources,
		the <b>findresource</b> operator returns only its name operand.
		However, <b>resourceforall</b> and <b>resourcestatus</b> are useful
		for inquiring about the availability of capabilities such as specific
		filter algorithms.

	</table>
	<p>
		The <b>Category</b> and <b>Generic</b> resources are used in defining
		new categories of resources. This capability is described in Section
		3.9.3, "Creating Resource Categories."
	</p>
	<p>
		The resource operators&mdash;<b>findresource</b>, <b>resourcestatus</b>,
		<b>resourceforall</b>, <b>defineresource</b>, and <b>undefineresource</b>&mdash;have
		standard behavior that is uniform across all resource categories. This
		behavior is specified in the operator descriptions in Chapter 8. For
		some categories, the operators have additional semantics that are
		category-specific. The following sections describe the semantics of
		each resource category.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em><b>Note:</b> Except as indicated below, the PostScript
			language does not prescribe that a resource category must contain any
			standard instances. Some categories may be populated with predefined
			instances, but the set of instances is product-dependent.</em>
	</p>
	<h4 id="1">Font</h4>
	<p>
		Instance names of the <b>Font</b> resource category are font names,
		such as Times-Roman. The instances are font dictionaries that are
		suitable for use as operands to <b>scalefont</b> or <b>makefont</b>,
		which produce a transformed font dictionary that can be used to paint
		characters on the page.
	</p>
	<p>The following special-purpose operators apply only to fonts but
		are otherwise equivalent to the resource operators:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>findfont</b>, equivalent to /Font findresource</li>
		<li><b>definefont</b>, equivalent to /Font defineresource</li>
		<li><b>undefinefont</b>, equivalent to /Font undefineresource
	</ul>
	<p>
		The <b>definefont</b> and <b>undefinefont</b> operators have
		additional font-specific semantics, which are described under those
		operators in Chapter 8. Those semantics also apply to <b>defineresource</b>
		and <b>undefineresource</b> when applied to the Font category. <b>findfont</b>
		and <b>definefont</b> are available in LanguageLevel 1, even though
		the general facility for named resources is a LanguageLevel 2 feature.
	</p>
	<p>The font operators also maintain dictionaries of font names and
		Font resource instances that are defined in VM. Those dictionaries are
		FontDirectory (all Font resources in VM) and GlobalFontDirectory (only
		Font resources in global VM). They are obsolete, but are provided for
		compatibility with existing applications. The preferred method of
		enumerating all available Font resources is</p>
	<pre>
    (*) proc scratch /Font resourceforall
    </pre>
	<p>
		where proc is a procedure and scratch is a string used repeatedly to
		hold font names. This method works for all available <b>Font</b>
		resources, whether or not they are in VM. Normally, it is preferable
		to use <b>resourcestatus</b> to determine the availability of specific
		resources rather than enumerate all resources and check whether those
		of interest are in the list.
	</p>
	<p>
		When <b>findresource</b> or <b>findfont</b> loads a font from an
		external source into VM, it may choose to use global VM rather than
		the current VM allocation mode. This choice depends on memory
		management algorithms used by the interpreter. It also depends on the
		font type, since certain Type 3 fonts do not work correctly when
		loaded into global VM. The details of this policy are
		implementationdependent; a PostScript program should not depend on
		knowing what they are.
	</p>
	<h4 id="2">CIDFont</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>CIDFont</b> resource category <i>(LanguageLevel
			3)</i> are dictionaries that are suitable for use with the <b>composefont</b>
		operator to construct CID-keyed fonts, as described in Section 5.11,
		"CID-Keyed Fonts." The <b>defineresource</b> operator has certain
		category-specific semantics when applied to the <b>CIDFont</b>
		category; furthermore, the <b>definefont</b> and <b>undefinefont</b>
		operators can be applied to CIDFonts as well as fonts. For more
		information on the behavior of these operators, see Section 5.11.3,
		"CIDFont Dictionaries."
	</p>
	<h4 id="3">CMap</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>CMap</b> resource category <i>(LanguageLevel
			3)</i> are character code mapping dictionaries that are suitable for use
		with the <b>composefont</b> operator to construct CID-keyed fonts, as
		described in Section 5.11, "CID-Keyed Fonts."
	</p>
	<h4 id="4">FontSet</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>FontSet</b> resource category (LanguageLevel 3)
		are bundles of font definitions that are represented in the Compact
		Font Format (CFF) or other multiple-font representations, as described
		in Section 5.8.1, "Type 2 and Type 14 Fonts (CFF and Chameleon)." Each
		<b>FontSet</b> instance contains the material from which one or more <b>Font</b>
		instances can be constructed.
	</p>
	<h4 id="5">Encoding</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>Encoding</b> resource category are array objects,
		suitable for use as the <b>Encoding</b> entry of font dictionaries
		(see Section 5.3, "Character Encoding"). An encoding array usually
		contains 256 names, permitting it to be indexed by any 8-bit character
		code. An encoding array for use with composite fonts (described in
		Section 5.10, "Composite Fonts") contains integers instead of names,
		and can be of any length.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two standard encodings that are permanently defined in VM
		and available by name in <b>systemdict</b>:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>StandardEncoding</b>, whose value is the same as the array
			returned by /StandardEncoding /Encoding findresource</li>
		<li><b>ISOLatin1Encoding</b>, whose value is the same as the
			array returned by /ISOLatin1Encoding /Encoding findresource</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If any other encodings exist, they are available only through <b>findresource</b>.
		The convenience operator <b>findencoding</b> is equivalent to
		/Encoding findresource.
	</p>
	<h4 id="6">Form</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>Form</b> resource category are form dictionaries,
		described in Section 4.7, "Forms." A form dictionary is suitable as
		the operand to the <b>execform</b> operator to render the form on the
		page.
	</p>
	<h4 id="7">Pattern</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>Pattern</b> resource category are prototype
		pattern dictionaries, described in Section 4.9, "Patterns." A
		prototype pattern dictionary is suitable as the operand to the <b>makepattern</b>
		operator, which produces a transformed pattern dictionary; a
		PostScript program can then use the resulting dictionary in painting
		operations by establishing a Pattern color space or by invoking the <b>setpattern</b>
		operator.
	</p>
	<h4 id="8">ProcSet</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>ProcSet</b> resource category are procedure sets.
		A procedure set is a dictionary containing named procedures or
		operators. Application prologs can be organized as one or more
		procedure sets that are available from a library instead of being
		included in-line in every document that uses them. The <b>ProcSet</b>
		resource category provides a way to organize such a library.
	</p>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 3, there are several standard instances of the <b>ProcSet</b>
		category that are associated with specific features of the PostScript
		language. These procedure sets, listed in Table 3.10, contain
		procedures, operators, and other objects that a PostScript program can
		access as part of using those features.
	</p>

		</tr>
	</table>
	<h4 id="9">ColorSpace</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>ColorSpace</b> resource category are array objects
		that represent fully parameterized color spaces. The first element of
		a color space array is a color space family name; the remaining
		elements are parameters to the color space (see Section 4.8, "Color
		Spaces").
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Note: The ColorSpace resource category is distinct from the <b>ColorSpaceFamily</b>
			category, described below.
		</em>
	</p>
	<h4 id="10">Halftone</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>Halftone</b> resource category are halftone
		dictionaries, suitable as operands to the <b>sethalftone</b> operator
		(see Section 7.4, "Halftones").
	</p>
	<h4 id="11">ColorRendering</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>ColorRendering</b>b resource category are color
		rendering dictionaries, suitable as operands to the <b>setcolorrendering</b>
		operator (see Section 7.1, "CIE-Based Color to Device Color").
	</p>
	<h4 id="12">IdiomSet</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>IdiomSet</b> resource category <i>(LanguageLevel
			3)</i> are procedure substitution dictionaries, for use with the <b>bind</b>
		operator (see Section 3.12.1, "bind Operator").
	</p>
	<h4 id="13">InkParams and TrapParams</h4>
	<p>
		The LanguageLevel 3 resource categories <b>InkParams</b> and <b>TrapParams</b>
		are present only in products that support in-RIP trapping (see Section
		6.3, "In-RIP Trapping"). Instances of <b>InkParams</b> are
		dictionaries that define trapping-related properties of device
		colorants; instances of <b>TrapParams</b> are dictionaries that define
		sets of trapping parameters suitable as operands to the <b>settrapparams</b>
		operator.
	</p>
	<h4 id="14">OutputDevice</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>OutputDevice</b> resource category (LanguageLevel
		3) are dictionaries that describe certain capabilities of a particular
		page device, such as the possible page sizes or resolutions (see
		Section 6.4, "Output Device Dictionary").
	</p>
	<h4 id="15">ControlLanguage, PDL, Localization, and HWOptions</h4>
	<p>
		Instances of the LanguageLevel 3 resource categories <b>ControlLanguage</b>,
		<b>PDL</b>, <b>Localization</b>, and <b>HWOptions</b> provide
		information that is product-dependent, as summarized below. For
		further details, see the <a
			href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/ps/PS3010and3011.Supplement.pdf">PostScript
			Language Reference Supplement</a>.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Instances of <b>ControlLanguage</b> are dictionaries that
			describe the control languages available in a product. A control
			language is a means for controlling product features, such as default
			configuration and status reporting.
		</li>
		<li>Instances of <b>PDL</b> are dictionaries that describe the
			page description language interpreters available in a product. This
			category supersedes the <b>Emulator</b> implicit resource category,
			because its instances provide a more complete description of each
			interpreter (or emulator).
		</li>
		<li>Instances of <b>Localization</b> are dictionaries that
			describe the natural languages (for example, English, Japanese, or
			German) supported by a product.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 id="16">Implicit Resources</h4>
	<p>
		For all implicit resources, the <b>findresource</b> operator returns
		the instance's key if the instance is defined. The <b>resourcestatus</b>
		and <b>resourceforall</b> operators have their normal behavior,
		although the status and size values returned by <b>resourcestatus</b>
		are meaningless. The <b>defineresource</b> and <b>undefineresource</b>
		operators are ordinarily not allowed, but the ability to define new
		instances of implicit resources may exist in some implementations. The
		mechanisms are implementation-dependent.
	</p>
	<p>
		The instances of the <b>Filter</b> category are filter names, such as
		<b>ASCII85Decode</b> and <b>RunLengthEncode</b>, which are used as an
		operand of the <b>filter</b> operator to determine its behavior.
		Filters are described in Section 3.8.4, "Filters."
	</p>
	<p>
		The instances of the <b>ColorSpaceFamily</b> category are color space
		family names, which appear as the first element of a color space array
		object. Some color spaces, such as <b>DeviceRGB</b>, are completely
		determined by their family name; others, such as <b>CIEBasedABC</b>,
		require additional parameters to describe them. Color spaces are
		described in Section 4.8, "Color Spaces."
	</p>
	<p>
		The instances of the <b>Emulator</b> category are names of emulators
		for languages other than PostScript that may be built into a
		particular implementation. Those emulators are not a standard part of
		the PostScript language, but one or more of them may be present in
		some products. This category has been superseded by the <b>PDL</b>
		resource category in LanguageLevel 3.
	</p>
	<p>
		The instances of the <b>IODevice</b> category are names of device
		parameter sets. Some parameter sets are associated with input/output
		devices, from which the category name <b>IODevice</b> originates.
		However, there are also some parameter sets that do not correspond to
		physical devices. The keys for all instances of this category are
		expressed as strings of the form %device%. See Section C.4, "Device
		Parameters."
	</p>
	<p>
		The instances of the <b>ColorRenderingType</b>, <b>FMapType</b>, <b>FontType</b>,
		<b>FormType</b>, <b>HalftoneType</b>, <b>ImageType</b>, <b>PatternType</b>,
		<b>FunctionType</b>, <b>ShadingType</b>, and <b>TrappingType</b>
		categories are integers that are the acceptable values for the
		correspondingly named entries in various classes of special
		dictionaries. For example, in LanguageLevel 3 the <b>FMapType</b>
		category includes the integers 1 through 9 as keys; if an interpreter
		supports additional FMapType values, the <b>FMapType</b> category will
		also include those values as instances.
	</p>
