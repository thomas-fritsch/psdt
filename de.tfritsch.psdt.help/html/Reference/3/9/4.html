	<h3>3.9.4 Resource as Files</h3>
	<p>The PostScript language does not specify how external resources
		are installed, how they are loaded, or what correspondence, if any,
		exists between resource names and file names. In general, all
		knowledge of such things is in the category implementation dictionary
		and in environment-dependent installation software.</p>
	<p>
		Typically, resource instances are installed as named files, which can
		also be accessed by ordinary PostScript file operators such as <b>file</b>
		and <b>run</b>. There is a straightforward mapping from resource names
		to file names, though the details of this mapping vary because of
		restrictions on file name syntax imposed by the underlying file
		system.
	</p>
	<p>
		In some implementations, including many dedicated printers, the only
		access to the file system is through the PostScript interpreter. In
		such environments, it is important for PostScript programs to be able
		to access the underlying resource files directly in order to install
		or remove them. Only resource installation or other system management
		software should do this. Page descriptions should never attempt to
		access resources as files; they should use only resource operators,
		such as <b>findresource</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The implementation dictionary for a category can contain an optional
		entry, <b>ResourceFileName</b>, which is a procedure that translates
		from a resource name to a file name. If the procedure exists, a
		program can call it as follows:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Push the category implementation dictionary on the dictionary
			stack. The <b>ResourceFileName</b> procedure requires this step in
			order to obtain categoryspecific information, such as <b>Category</b>.
		</li>
		<li>Push the instance name and a scratch string on the operand
			stack. The scratch string must be long enough to accept the complete
			file name for the resource.</li>
		<li>Execute <b>ResourceFileName</b>.
		</li>
		<li>Pop the dictionary stack.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<b>ResourceFileName</b> builds a complete file name in the scratch
		string and returns on the operand stack the substring that was used.
		This string can then be used as the filename operand of file operators
		such as <b>file</b>, <b>deletefile</b>, <b>status</b>, and so on. For
		example, the following program fragment obtains the file name for the
		Times-Roman font:
	</p>
	<pre>/Font /Category findresource
    begin
    /Times-Roman scratch ResourceFileName
    end
    </pre>
	<p>
		If a <b>ResourceFileName</b> procedure for a particular category and
		instance name exists and executes without a PostScript error, it will
		leave a string on the stack. If that category maintains all of its
		instances as named files, this string is the name of the file for that
		instance. This file name may or may not contain the %device% prefix.
		Use of this file name with file operators may not succeed for a
		variety of reasons, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The category does not maintain all of its instances as named
			files.</li>
		<li>The operator tried to delete a file from a read-only file
			system.</li>
		<li>The operator tried to write to a file system with
			insufficient space.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		There may be a limit on the length of a resource file name, which in
		turn imposes a length limit on the instance name. The inherent limit
		on resource instance names is the same as that on name objects in
		general (see Appendix B). By convention, font names are restricted to
		fewer than 40 characters. This convention is recommended for other
		resource categories as well. Note that the resource file name may be
		longer or shorter than the resource instance name, depending on
		details of the name-mapping algorithm. When calling <b>ResourceFileName</b>,
		it is prudent to provide a scratch string at least 100 characters
		long.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some implementations provide additional control over the behavior of <b>ResourceFileName</b>;
		see Section C.3.6, "Resource File Location."
	</p>
	<p>
		A resource file contains a PostScript program that can be executed to
		load the resource instance into VM. The last action the program should
		take is to execute <b>defineresource</b> or an equivalent operator,
		such as <b>definefont</b>, to associate the resource instance with a
		category and a name. In other words, each resource file must be
		self-identifying and self-defining. The resource file must be well
		behaved: it must leave the stacks in their original state and it must
		not execute any operators (graphics operators, for instance) that are
		not directly related to creating the resource instance.
