	<h2>3.12.1 bind Operator</h2>
	<p>The bind operator takes a procedure operand and returns a
		possibly modified procedure. There are two kinds of modification:
		operator substitution and idiom recognition.</p>
	<h3 id="1">Operator Substitution</h3>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a> operator first
		systematically replaces names with operators in a procedure. For each
		executable name whose value is an operator (not an array, procedure,
		or other type), it replaces the name with the operator object. This
		lookup occurs in the dictionaries that are on the dictionary stack at
		the time bind is executed. The effect of <a
			href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a> applies not only to the
		procedure being bound but to all subsidiary procedures (executable
		arrays or executable packed arrays) contained within it, nested to
		arbitrary depth.
	</p>
	<p>
		When the interpreter subsequently executes this procedure, it
		encounters the <i>operator objects</i>, not the <i>names</i> of
		operators. For example, if the <b>average</b> procedure has been
		defined as
	</p>
	<pre>/average {add 2 div} bind def</pre>
	<p>
		then during the execution of <b>average</b>, the interpreter executes
		the <a href="../../8/2/a/add.html">add</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/d/div.html">div</a> operators directly, without
		looking up the names <b>add</b> and <b>div</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two main benefits to using <a href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a>:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A procedure that has been bound will execute the sequence of
			operators that were intended when the procedure was defined, even if
			one or more of the operator names have been redefined in the
			meantime. This benefit is mainly of interest in procedures that are
			part of the PostScript implementation, such as <a
			href="../../8/2/f/findfont.html">findfont</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/@/equals.html">=</a>. Those procedures are expected
			to behave correctly and uniformly, regardless of how a user program
			may have altered its name environment.
		</li>
		<li>A bound procedure executes somewhat faster than one that has
			not been bound, since the interpreter need not look up the operator
			names each time, but can execute the operators directly. This benefit
			is of interest in most PostScript programs, particularly in the
			prologs of page descriptions. It is worthwhile to apply <a
			href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a> to any procedure that will be
			executed more than a few times.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		It is important to understand that <a href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a>
		replaces only those names whose values are operators at the time <a
			href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a> is executed. Names whose values
		are of other types, particularly procedures, are not disturbed. If an
		operator name has been redefined in some dictionary above <a
			href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a> on the dictionary
		stack before the execution of <a href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a>,
		occurrences of that name in the procedure will not be replaced.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note:</b> Certain standard language features, such as <a
			href="../../8/2/f/findfont.html">findfont</a>, are implemented as
			built-in procedures rather than as operators. Also, certain names,
			such as <a href="../../8/2/t/true.html">true</a>, <a
			href="../../8/2/f/false.html">false</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/n/null.html">null</a>, are associated directly with
			literal values in <a href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>.
			Occurrences of such names in a procedure are not altered by <a
			href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a>.</i>
	</p>
	<h3 id="2">Idiom Recognition</h3>
	<p>
		In LanguageLevel 3, the <a href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a>
		operator performs an additional task, known as <i>idiom
			recognition</i>, following the replacement of names in the bound
		procedure with operators. The goal of idiom recognition is to replace
		certain procedures ("idioms") with other procedures, typically ones
		that have equivalent behavior but produce better-quality results or
		execute more efficiently. Performing such substitution on procedures
		in an application's prolog can take advantage of new language features
		without changing the application.
	</p>
	<p>
		The idioms and their replacements are stored as instances of the <b>IdiomSet</b>
		resource category. An <b>IdiomSet</b> instance is a <i>procedure
			substitution dictionary</i>, which typically contains idioms for a
		particular application's prolog. The keys in this dictionary are
		arbitrary. Each value in this dictionary is an array containing two
		procedures, a <i>template procedure</i> and a <i>substitute
			procedure</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a> operator first tests the
		value of the user parameter <b>IdiomRecognition</b> to see whether
		idiom recognition is enabled. If so, the bound procedure is compared
		to every template procedure in every <b>IdiomSet</b> instance. If a
		match is found, <a href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a> returns the
		associated substitute procedure; otherwise, it returns the bound
		procedure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Two arrays or procedures are considered to match if corresponding
		elements either are equal (in the sense of the <a
			href="../../8/2/e/eq.html">eq</a> operator) or are both arrays whose
		corresponding elements match in turn. The objects' attributes are
		disregarded during this comparison, just as they are by <a
			href="../../8/2/e/eq.html">eq</a>. Nested arrays or procedures are
		compared to a maximum depth of ten levels.
	</p>
	<p>
		If substitutions may have an undesirable effect, idiom recognition can
		be disabled by setting the value of the user parameter <b>IdiomRecognition</b>
		to false before invoking the <a href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a>
		operator. For example, <b>IdiomRecognition</b> should be set to false
		during the construction of instances of the <b>IdiomSet</b> resource
		category, so that the template and substitute procedures are not
		themselves recognized as idioms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Example 3.9 demonstrates how to construct an instance of the <b>IdiomSet</b>
		resource category.
	</p>

	<p>
		The template and substitute procedures should be bound explicitly
		during the definition of the <b>IdiomSet</b> instance, since no
		automatic binding occurs on either of these procedures during idiom
		recognition. The comparison during idiom recognition occurs after the
		candidate procedure is bound; a successful match depends on the
		template also being bound. Generally, the substitute procedure should
		be bound, unless lookup of operator names during each execution of the
		substitute procedure is specifically desired.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instances of the <b>IdiomSet</b> resource category reside in VM,
		either local or global; if local, they are subject to the <a
			href="../../8/2/s/save.html">save</a> and <a
			href="../../8/2/r/restore.html">restore</a> operators. The <a
			href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a> operator follows the usual
		rules about visibility of resources according to the current VM
		allocation mode. That is, if the current VM allocation mode is global,
		only globally defined instances of <b>IdiomSet</b> are considered,
		whereas if the current allocation mode is local, both locally and
		globally defined instances are considered. Additionally, substitution
		will not occur if the candidate procedure is in global VM but the
		proposed substitute procedure is in local VM.
	</p>
	<p>
		Multiple instances of the <b>IdiomSet</b> resource category may
		contain identical template procedures, but only one will be in effect
		when idiom recognition is enabled. The instance that takes precedence
		is not predictable.
	</p>
	<p>
		As mentioned earlier, idiom recognition is performed by matching the
		template procedures in the <b>IdiomSet</b> resource instances. This is
		unlike all other resource categories, whose instances are selected
		according to their keys. This matching by value occurs only for <b>IdiomSet</b>
		instances that are defined in VM; <a href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a>
		does not consider instances that are not in VM but only in external
		storage.
	</p>
	<p>
		To ensure that the instances in VM are consistent with the external
		ones, the interpreter automatically invokes <a
			href="../../8/2/f/findresource.html">findresource</a> to load
		external <b>IdiomSet</b> instances into VM at the beginning of each
		job and at certain other times. If a PostScript program installs an
		external IdiomSet instance, it should then execute <a
			href="../../8/2/u/undefineresource.html">undefineresource</a> to
		ensure that any existing instance of <b>IdiomSet</b> in VM with the
		same key is removed and replaced by the external instance.
