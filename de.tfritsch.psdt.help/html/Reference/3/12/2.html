	<h2>3.12.2 Immediately Evaluated Names</h2>
	<p>
		LanguageLevels 2 and 3, as well as most LanguageLevel 1
		implementations (see Appendix A), include a syntax feature called <i>immediately
			evaluated names</i>. When the PostScript language scanner encounters a
		token of the form //name (a name preceded by two slashes with no
		intervening spaces), it immediately looks up the name and substitutes
		the corresponding value. This lookup occurs in the dictionaries on the
		dictionary stack at the time the scanner encounters the token. If it
		cannot find the name, an <a href="../../8/2/u/undefined.html">undefined</a>
		error occurs.
	</p>
	<p>
		The substitution occurs immediately&mdash;even inside an executable
		array delimited by { and }, where execution is deferred. Note that
		this process is a substitution and not an execution; that is, the
		name's value is not executed, but rather is substituted for the name
		itself, just as if the <a href="../../8/2/l/load.html">load</a>
		operator were applied to the name.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most common use of immediately evaluated names is to perform early
		binding of objects (other than operators) in procedure definitions.
		The <a href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a> operator, described in
		the previous section, performs early binding of operators; binding
		objects of other types requires the explicit use of immediately
		evaluated names.
	</p>
	<p>Example 3.10 illustrates the use of an immediately evaluated
		name to bind a reference to a dictionary.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example 3.10</b>
	</p>
	<pre>
/mydict &lt;&lt; ... &gt;&gt; def
/proc
  { //mydict begin
    ...
    end
  } bind def</pre>
	<p>In the definition of proc, //mydict is an immediately evaluated
		name. At the moment the scanner encounters the name, it substitutes
		the name's current value, which is the dictionary defined earlier in
		the example. The first element of the executable array proc is a
		dictionary object, not a name object. When proc is executed, it will
		access that dictionary, even if in the meantime mydict has been
		redefined or the definition has been removed.</p>
	<p>
		Another use of immediately evaluated names is to refer directly to
		permanent objects: standard dictionaries, such as <a
			href="../../8/2/s/systemdict.html">systemdict</a>, and constant
		literal objects, such as the values of <a href="../../8/2/t/true.html">true</a>,
		<a href="../../8/2/f/false.html">false</a>, and <a
			href="../../8/2/n/null.html">null</a>. On the other hand, it does not
		make sense to treat the names of variables as immediately evaluated
		names. Doing so would cause a procedure to be irrevocably bound to
		particular values of those variables.
	</p>
	<p>
		A word of caution: Indiscriminate use of immediately evaluated names
		may change the behavior of a program. As discussed in Section <a
			href="../5.html">3.5, "Execution,"</a> the behavior of a procedure
		differs depending on whether the interpreter encounters it directly or
		as the result of executing some other object (a name or an operator).
		Execution of the program fragments
	</p>
	<pre>
{... b ...}
{... //b ...}</pre>
	<p>
		will have different effects if the value of the name b is a procedure.
		So it is inadvisable to treat the names of operators as immediately
		evaluated names. A program that does so will malfunction in an
		environment in which some operators have been redefined as procedures.
		This is why <a href="../../8/2/b/bind.html">bind</a> applies only to
		names whose values are operators, not procedures or other types.
